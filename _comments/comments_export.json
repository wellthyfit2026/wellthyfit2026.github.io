After reading some reviews all my excitement died down, it was kind of mixed reviews, some were complaining about  product quality, eg doesn't smell good,  one was talking about white sugary layer which is formed in every other  honey.

    "content": "Good article. Keep up the good work in educating fellow runners. Your workout suggestions are good too. I do have some comments:\n\n1. Literature on Lactate Threshold and Anaerobic Threshold has evolved over the time and so we find some conflicting information. For all practical purposes, there is enough consensus that these two are essentially same and used interchangeably. Lactate threshold term is more commonly used. Lactic acid that is not cleared fast enough by mitochondria seeps into blood causing the accumulation. If you look at your second sentence under LT, it is essentially same as 1st sentence under Anaerobic threshold. Threshold is an inflection point where we reach a point it is not being cleared fast enough\n2. Tempo or LT pace is the pace that one can sustain for '60 min in a race'. You were trying to say the same thing in the last sentence under Anaerobic threshold but perhaps an oversight when you didn't mention about the race. The second part of that sentence I believe talks about maintaining 20 to 40 in 'a training run'. You may want to update that sentence to make it more explicit as it is confusing\n3. I beg to differ on your assertion that 71%-75% of max heart rate pace is half marathon pace. That is usually easy run or long run pace. 85 to 90% of max heart race is typical for half marathon pace (google it or check out Jack Daniels). My max HR is close to 190 and my average heart rate for half marathons is usually between 165 and 170\n4. For the workouts based on '1 hour race pace: LT/tempo pace' (10k based workouts in your writeup), it is usually difficult to sustain it for 40 min for some one who is just starting these workouts. So one can start with 20 min and slowly work your way to 40 min. For interval style workouts, one can also do it based on time: Starting with 3 x 8 min with 2 min jog in between and slowly work towards 4 x 12 min with 2 min jog in between",

    "content": "Having one thought only for as long as possible is Meditation. The average thoughts that our mind generates in 24 hour cycle is forty thousand of them. Running helps in us to concentrate on one thought - this is generated by the inspiration of running. So in a nutshell one is Meditating while running. Gee Ess I am proud of you having discovered this phenomena. Wishing you all the very best and millions more healthy days physically and mentally.",

Like you I also have this nice addiction and have been running in marathons whenever possible or daily running six days 10 to 12 km in 42 to 52 mins is essential or else eating becomes difficult. At the given time in the morning or evening the legs takes you to hit the road. I feel it's a good addiction but some friends do advise that one should slow down now...only one knows that it is difficult to get out of it now. Kudos... to you to have blogged this article....",

    "content": "Few add ons.\nRunning is a moving gait . The whole body works in unison . Why not an overall body fitness .Core endurance should be sought . My thoughts are some where it's replaced by just few exercises and undue focus on it .\nCore muscles contracts  much before the extremities . It's a Neuro adaptation . Your simple thought of running will activate the nervous system . It's in unison . \n\nYour arm reach of left side decides the knee lift of the right side .  Important aspect of running biomechanics .Body has myofascial planes to do so .your upper body decides the fate of what happens in the later part of the race .\n\nCadence do play a role but stride length is double the contributor ..67% to pace . Stride length Is a function of pace  . And strides have to do with leg length ( Froude's number ) and it effects your cadence .Cadence is overrated . Being nimble is enough . \n\nPlease pass on the references / study of non elite runners where change of cadence has made difference in foot strike . three fourth of the midfoot strikers are basically heel strikers .\n\nMy whole point is nobody focuses running as an act of unison . You need a overrall body fitness for a safe injury free running .",

    "content": "Thank you for your truly informed observations and comments.   Yes, running is a full body activity with best results being obtained when we train all parts in an integrated manner. The core is a classic sum of most (not all) major muscle groups involved in running. A 5-10% increase in cadence by the recreational runner does result in good gains. Ofcourse, the focus on these two has to be within the overall gamut of a well-balanced training program (your point exactly).",

The equal status to women cannot be achieved by giving lectures, providing reservation, or by opening special separate institutions etc. \nTo stand up for their equal status, we have to change our old visualisation of women, we have to start respecting the role reversals, we have to get ourselves used to seeing our women out of kitchens. We have to start accepting women in lead roles. We have to change our double standards. Anuradha you may not be raised up to dress up the way we see you now but you were born to be the way you want to be and to inspire other women to be what they want to be.",

It's not that husbands are not liberated but these poor guys are aware of the preying Hawks around you.

But does even the best archer / shooter hit it every single time? No..there are too many human variations. and 21k / 42K is a long distance. \n\nBut some folks have chosen to take this single aspect and write long posts on performance evaluation of pacers. To my mind this is very contrary to the spirit of the sport which is about being social and helping each other,,,which is what pacers get out to do.\n\nThanks for putting your thoughts together.\n\nVenkat",

With this 100 days of Running challenge going on , I have been advised to run slow for next one month to handle blisters in forefoot.\nSo I think it would be great time to implement above theory to practice. So can u please email me the PDF. That would be of great benefit.\n\nThanking you in advance",

I feel run timings create the same pressure marks did in school, placement did in college etc.\nI have seen the pressure that a sub 2 created in a half. And frankly as a number it is stupid and out of illogical. People drop out of runs just because they feel they won't get impressive timings. And let me out it there in the open: it even makes people (like me) opt for pacing.\n\nWhat we should share, however, is our run frequency and distance, because these are the two factors that naturally give you speed.\nShare the journey, not the destination.",

The problem is with unhealthy processed carbs (especially the dips we get in the market)! You would also know that there is a huge part of this world that eats rice for breakfast, so that they can get more energy. I am particularly heavy on carbs because I have a very very active day. I run almost 5 times a week, and do yoga also almost everyday. Am on my toes nearly 14 hours a day! That mean I do need a lot of energy. Plus I eat chicken for lunch or some beans everyday.

So we need some power moves, some core strength building - planks, squats, lunges. I would suggest - you run 3 times a week and 2 days add some good strength training to your routine. I have been through a similar phase and this is what has worked for me.\n\nlet me know,",

    "content": "Nice article. Nothing new though. But yes, for those with a tendency to give up as they expect instant gratification via results, this is a timely article. I would add  cycling to the list of endurance sports. Running for people with weight issues is a difficult activity. P.S: I've been running for over 30 years now. I have added long distance cycling. I do not subscribe to running 5-6 times a week as it can result in injuries. I advice 3 runs a week. And alternate with cycling/swimming/Yoga/Strength training. ",

As said in the body of the text, other food will also serve the propose, like a banana. The gels are not drugs or boosters, it is a mix-conception to think that they provide some kind of enhancement for your performance, helping you to do better.... No, that's not the case: the gels are not a substitute of  the training, the remedy for lazy people.",

When you have so many things going on in your life both on personal and professional front, taking care of yourself comes in last - UNTIL someday you tell yourself - G I have put on too much. The \"you\" I am talking about is ME. I used to gym and then drop out and then continue but last year in August I took a serious attempt and lost 12 kgs in 3 months. Required quite some disciple on food and also waking up every morning at 05:30. I am glad I did it because I am getting happier even though I am not where I really want to be.\nI would love to have a club for people like us to motivate each other. People ask me - so whats the reason including if you are having a new woman in your life. Guess what - how about me wanting to have a new ME more fit, lean and healthier.\nCheers and kudos to your achievement. Look forward to seeing you around soon before I leave Asia for good!!!",

Can you help me out with the exact exercises for each\nI would also like to know this part - I try to work on a max of 2 muscle groups during weights and in my mix day, I try to do low weight whole body.\nAnd also any specific exercises which help in breathing easy during run. I used to run 10km once a week but found that I would stop not because there was a pain in my leg but because I was breathless.\nWould appreciate any pointers you could provide",

    "content": "Hey, thanks for the band suggestion on Gomukha Asana. I used to it so very well in 1980 when yoga had cured my asthma. I know I get so damn frustrated not being able to be half there.\nThe band will get me there.\nMost of the standing stretches are a part of a runner's post run stretching, though.\nI do a Thahrav Surya Namaskar post run, where I hold each pose for 30 seconds. Also helps me avoid a wheeze which sets in if I do regular paced Surya Namaskars.\n\nAs I said earlier, I do carry an impression that runners ain't that flexible as a genre. That's because in the 'Expo' of the first ever RnL Full Marathon in Gurgaon (22/2/09), we were all made to do some Yoga stretches and realized how stiff we all are, especially in the bending ones.",

    "content": "Yes, it is 'fine' for a runner, unless you want to cut out sugar for more holistic health reasons. Coffee is easy - reduce the amount of sugar slowly over a period of 1-2 weeks, maybe a quarter of a spoon every few days. If you absolutely do need sugar, keep it to less than half a teaspoon and try using unprocessed sugar. I know people who add honey, but my research says that the chemical composition of honey doesn't make it well suited for heating, so I don't use honey in anything that is above lukewarm temperature.\nAs for sweets, what does occasional sweets mean? That's something that you will need to determine for yourself. Is it one cheat day a week, only on special occasions, or would you rather not deprive yourself and eat a small, controlled quantity of a sweet a day? It really is up to how much you are willing to sacrifice. Also consider replacing sweets you'd normally have with healthier sweets. I tend to eat a few raisins or a small piece of jaggery after a meal sometimes if I really feel like ending on a sweet note. You don't need to eliminate sweets entirely, just choose healthier ones. I call it a less-sugar diet :-).",

It wasn't easy for her and believe me, family size has nothing to do with it. There are detractors every where and her mind is as big a nay-sayer as any of ours. The difference is that she chose to prioritise her health and well-being over everything else and kept at it, against all odds. \nYou are an inspiration Rukhsana and I wish many more thousand miles with that infectious smile !!

The only running organizer in NCR at one time was RnL, and by God, I was late for eacxh of his races. Not super late, but 5-10 minutes late. Except the time I paced a first timer to her first 8 hour marathon. Then I was before time because I wasn't running for myself. \nApart from all of Rahul's runs, I was late for my first ever Half Marathon. It was called the VDHM that year (Airtel took over nexxt year). I was almost barred from entry, so that ensired that I was always on time for my ADHMs!\nIn my 50th year I decided to run the 50 mile at Bhatti. I was late by half an hour.\nOh, and by the way,  I am the most poorly photographed runner when on time!",

No one in this world born with the knowledge of everything. It's a matter of learning and that also Step by Step and Gradually. \n\nAnyone who do / achieve anything 1st time, their joy, excitement is on different level and they express a lot and really want to show what they have done it. So, by not knowing much thing in 1st race, their claim of calling 2, 3,5 and 10 k Road races as \"Marathon\" should be accepted. After getting addicted, they learn gradually day by day, month on month, year on year , race on race and then they realise that Marathon means 42km (42.195km). So, whoever claim / call 2, 3, 5 or 10k races as \"Marathon\" should be accepted by the Matured (Intermediate / Advanced) Runners considering that it might be their 1st time do the race with less knowledge (Vocabularies related to the Running).",

One day I thought \"can't cycle but can run\"......and that was that. Being an asthmatic, my struggle with breathing keeps my pace low but after a 5km and an occasional 10km, the feeling is priceless. That is what keeps me going. My allergy problems are at least 70% lesser, did not take even one sick leave last year and most shockingly, the bad bad Gurgaon air around Diwali has (touchwood !) not caused me breathing problem like it used to before 2017. And you are so right about the 'me time'. I absolutely am addicted to that.  Cheers to the spirit of runners and here's hoping that we see more and more women pickup this wonderful habit !!",
