Last two weeks the air quality in Delhi and NCR has hit the Hazardous levels and now it's come to Government advisories asking the organizers of the  biggest running event of north India - Airtel Delhi Half Marathon (ADHM) to Cancel this event as it would be very harmful for the runners to run in the terrible air quality especially at the hour of the day!

I was doing my research on running in heavily polluted air and came across this article by [Guardian on Air Pollution : Should It Stop You from Exercising!](https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2012/aug/05/air-pollution-should-stop-you-exercising)


### Am an ardent runner! I run 4-5 times a week all year. I run through:


- Bone biting winters - I make myself a warm cuppa, drink it off and run through the fog of 5-6 degree winter mornings.

- Blazing summers. Not one, but weeks of 40 degrees + . I do my long runs, short runs - give me the distance, i'll do it. But I take good care of my Hydration!

- Soul shaking humidity. I did 4 half marathon on days when the humidity was more than 88% and temperatures were more than 35 degrees.


**All for ?** - The Love of Running!

SO for heaven sake why would I not run through a patch of polluted air? And why would I not run that one run I train for every year - ADHM!


### Where are the Government Advisories when


- Stadium Runs are organised to encourage runners to run for 24, 48 and 72 hours?

- What about the ultra runners out in the wild? - The ultra runs that are organised in deserts, in crazy mountain trails where the distances sometimes run upto 500 kms an the runners are out in the wild for days? Animals? Weather?

- What about high altitude running? Which is truly dangerous! Where are the government advisories then???? Where are the regulations??


Hate me for writing this - But I find the above 3 far more dangerous for human body than running through polluted air! I am not sure whether it is ok for a runner to run 100km in the wild?

I'll be saying the same things as my fellow lovely blogger Christine Pemberton if I wrote anymore on this tipic. So just in case you haven't read her perspective (which is the voice of at least 95% runners), there please CLICK HERE!

It takes a runner to understand the grit and guts of  runner! Finding your passion for any execrsing is not easy.
