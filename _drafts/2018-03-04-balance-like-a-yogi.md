I did a 7 day Yoga Series called [#balancelikeayogi](https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/balancelikeayogi/) on my Instagram wellthyfit_tanyaagarwal
The first here is - the Eagle pose - Excellent post - run pose, brilliant for the tired calves, and helps with stretching the arms.
7 one legged standing poses!
The alignment of the body with gravity is crucial.
As we practice one legged poses, we learn to still the wobbling and create a sense of fluid stability ( I found this word and instantly loved it).
We fall because we lose focus again and again. So we go back and practice with unwavering alertness.

As you practice, it's OK to take wall or human support.
Remember - it takes sustained effort to centre and recentre.

 

The Extended Hand to Big Toe Pose.

Deeply stretches the hamstrings, shoulders and arms.
Develops Focus!
Pay attention to your base - whether you are seated or standing or balancing on your hands, how you're connected to the ground is going to affect the rest of your body.
Instead of pressing the whole foot on the mat, the trick is to learn to press the corners of your foot and lift your body up.
Remember - it takes sustained effort to centre and recentre!

 

The one legged warrior 3 pose.

Challenging and one that makes me feel like there is a mini - earthquake beneath my one balancing foot. It makes me believe that the mat also has a mind of its own.
Super for strengthening the ankles, tones the abdominal muscles and brings in focus like nothing else can.
We tend to forget - Balance is just like strength and flexibility, if you don't use it everyday, your body stops being able to do it.

 

The Tree Pose
One of the first postures any yogi learns. A foundational pose and one that every yogi must return to as much as possible.
It does look very easy. But ask anyone who has little balance how challenging it can get on the hips, balance, ankles and feet.
If you are a runner - try it post your run.
It brings great balance.
If you've had a cry week, just a few breaths in tree pose can be great to ground you.
Curbs anxiety and stress.
Great for spinal health and overall posture!


 

A variation of the warrior 3. Am pulling my arms back while keeping my leg strong on the ground. Slightly more challenging than the Warrior 3.
Balance. Strength. flexibility.
Practice. Practice. Practice.
Balance - like strength is everyday stuff.
Flexibility is a matter of intense hardwork.
Ever felt like a child learning to stand? That's balance for us adults.

 

This is the Dancer's pose. Also called the Natrajanasa. (See that beautiful painting in bg too)

There is grace, poise and sense of balance in it. Brings in strength in the lower body. Gives an ultimate stretch from the calves to the shoulders. Great hip flexor
Makes me feel very beautiful, uplifted, rooted and strong.
Remember - stay lifted and light from the pelvis up through the fingers.
Be rooted in the standing foot.
Visualise a line of energy lifting you towards the sky.

And finally. Don't be harsh on yourself. Take support if needed. You know you will get there with practice.

 

The King Dancer Pose.
If you saw Day 6 pose - the dancer pose, you will see that the King Dancer Pose is more challenging as it combines a backbend along with balancing!

This is a variation of the dancer pose.
The one legged Asana that needs huge amount of grounding before you take the arm up to hold the toe.
The ability to centre and recentre through balance takes time, you'll fall out of the pose many times, think of wobbling and falling as part of the dance, learn to flow with the fluctuations!
