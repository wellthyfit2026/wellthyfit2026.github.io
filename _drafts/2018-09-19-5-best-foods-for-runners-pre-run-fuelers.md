A runner is always on a look out for a high carbohydrate energy booster prior to the event. The best picks are foods that can provide energy over a sustained period of time, are easy to digest and do not cause any discomfort during the run. Here’s a list that you can rely on to fuel up!


- **Potato:**Contrary to popular myth, potatoes are not pure carbs. Infact a large potato can give you 7g of proteins (same as a katori of dal). It is loaded potassium, vitamin C and B vitamins, which help boosting your energy levels further. However, for a runner high fat potato preparations are not ideal as that can make you sluggish. Opt for homemade potato sabzi or just mashed potato on the side.

- **Banana:**This runners favorite carb is excellent source of energy to be had one hour prior to run. It is a good source of magnesium and potassium, which can help you skip muscle cramping during and after the run.

- **Amla:**Rich in vitamin C which is a strong antioxidant and reduces inflammation in the body. It also helps in increasing overall metabolic activity, which give a positive push to your energy levels.


 


- **Coffee:**It is a great boon to your run and best had 30-60 minutes prior for maximum efficiency. Don’t overdo it; maximum upto 2 shots of expresso for women and upto 3 shots for men are the magic numbers.

- **Fruit juice:**This can be a simple ingredient for your sports drink before and during the run. As opposed to drinking plain water, take 500ml of fruit juice, mix it with 500ml water and add a pinch of salt. There you go! You have your homemade sports drink ready.  Sip on 150ml every 20-30 mins during the run.
