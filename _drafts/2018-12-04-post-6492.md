*Not all civil servants live in the cage made of papers, forms and red tape.*
**Vishwas Narayan Nangare-Patil** is the Inspector General of Police, Kolhapur Range in the state of Maharashtra, India. Vishwas is an Indian Police Service officer of 1997 batch and in 2015 he was awarded the President's Police Medal (gallantry) for his role in the [2008 Mumbai attacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008_Mumbai_attacks).

Vishwaas Nagre Patil an Indian Police Services officer is inspiring thousands of people on daily basis. Beyond his duties of managing 5 districts, Vishwaas has made an amazing connect with 1000s of people through his own fitness and life philosophy.


Vishwaas is a marathoner. He has run the Mumbai, Satara, Goa, Thane, Aurangabad, Jyotiba marathons and has been an integral part in promoting the Pune Flo Marathon and inpsires people to train for running events. This is what he had to say when asked about his fitness routine.


> For physical fitness I go to gym, run 5kms on alternate days and long distance say 10/15kms on Sundays. I prefer to do weight training on rest of the days training group of two muscles a day, like standard back bicep, chest triceps, shoulder and legs. On the day of cardio, I do few sets of abs too. This makes my body toned. But the exercise is not  rigorous. For mind I do yoga, pranayama, yoganidra and meditation. Even writing and reading distresses me.

#### Vishwaas has worked very closely with film actor Akshay Kumar.


He wrote a personal letter to Akshay Kumar requesting him to come down for the inaugural ceremony of Maharashtra Youth Parliament Championship held at Satara. Akshay kumar came in his own chopper and at his own expenses! He interacted with the lady cops, girls students from rural areas so intensely and positively and donated for their education too. This event and the involvement of an actor of such stature speaks volumes about the larger than life role that Vishwaas is playing beyond his regular duties.

#### What keeps him fit despite a job that not only keeps him on his toes but also demands high level of focus and travel?

> I think in any of the job you may work for 10 hours and plan rest for the time for you and your family. I prefer to stay away from anything that is unproductive to my time. So I get lot of time for myself. Yes I need to travel a lot being IG of 5 big districts. But wherever I go, I take out my sports shoes and run. Or I get cycle and ride in the hinterlands. I see the mountain and I climb and I see the lake, take out my swimming costume and I jump into it!
