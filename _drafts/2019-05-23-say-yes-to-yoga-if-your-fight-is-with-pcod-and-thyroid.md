*Agility, Balance, Endurance, Vitality- the one thing that comes to our mind which gains victory over all of them is YOGA. A yogi conquers the body and makes it a fit vehicle for the spirit because he knows that a soul without a body is adjacent to bird deprived of its power to fly.*


*But
sometimes, ailments capture the bird and examines if he can still retain its
capability to fly. Let us have a quick look at some of the very common ailments
that are affecting our bodies to a sizeable extent*


***PCOD***

*It has
taken modern female generation by storm. It is a hormonal disorder which ladies
should understand at an early stage with its causes and future implications.
Irregular period cycles,  hirsutism,  weight gain especially around waist, acne,
dark pigmentation of skin around neck, difficulty in conceiving a baby are some
of the symptoms which should not be neglected by young female generation. In
words of science, Polycystic Ovarian Disease(PCOD) occurs when a number of
cysts start accumulating in women’s ovaries causing hormonal imbalances such as
androgen levels (male hormones) overpowering the female hormones.*

your story! It will inspire others”***

***THYROID***

## **THYROID**


*Thyroid
is basically a gland below the Adam’s apple in neck that secrets thyroid
hormones. Some times its dysfunction causes the gland to produce more than or
less than normal thyroid hormones which leads to an interruption with body’s
metabolism.  Coming Face to face with
problems like sluggishness, depression, cold intolerance, brittle hair, weight
gain, missed periods etc?  Get your
thyroid levels checked! The biggest thyroid problem among women is
hypothyroidism (underactive thyroid ) 
which affects almost 1 out of 8 women in world.*


***“The pain you are feeling, can’t be compared to the joy that is
coming”***


***CORRELATION
BETWEEN PCOD AND THYROID***


*Despite
their unique biologies, they share some features out of which the most notable
one is polycystic ovaries. In PCOD, high androgen levels prevent the follicles
of ovaries from maturing which can’t release egg cells and take the form of
cysts. In THYROID, we encounter a rise in level of prolactin which is one of
the major causes of ovulation absence.*


*Other
shared features between PCOD and Hashimoto’s thyroiditis are Obesity, Thyroid
Autoimmunity, higher LH-FSH Ratio (hormones that regulate menstrual cycle) etc.*


***BOTTOM
LINE***


*While
the features suggest a definite relationship between the two, it is more
sensible to get the testing done for second if you are facing either one of the
conditions.*

## ***“Struggle is part of the story!***


***OKAY!
I HAVE BOTH PROBLEMS! WHAT NEXT?***


*What
next? Treat them! Simple! But do remember, there is no cure for PCOD but it can
be controlled by lifestyle management and weight loss which is suffices in most
cases. A study shows that if you reduce your weight by 5%, you are likely to
initiate the correction of this disease. Oral contraceptive pills are advised
to manage menstrual irregularities. They decrease androgen levels in our body
since they consists estrogen and progestin which also reduce the risk of**endometrial cancer. Similarly, drugs like Thyronorm, Thyroxin, Eltroxin
are prescribed for controlling Thyroid. 
But allopathic medication comes with unimaginable side effects because
they are basically chemicals ingested inside a human to kill the symptoms and
provide relief. We agree Yoga single handedly, will not cure PCOD and Thyroid
but we can improve the symptoms and by regular practicing can eradicate them as
well.*

## ***YOGASANAS FOR PCOD***


*Yoga has been found more
effective than other conventional exercises since it can contend and even root
out stress completely. Stress has been found a notable factor that exaggerates
PCOD. Yoga therapy also stretches the pelvic area keeping the ovary and uterus
healthy. It helps in regulating endocrine glands in our body thereby
maintaining hormonal imbalances. Following are the most important yogasans and
pranayams to keep a check on PCOD:*
