1. Social distancing to not spread a disease is something EXTREME!


2. It is about maintaining 3-4 feet gap from people, if you do happen to go out.


3. It is about not using any...absolutely any public facility like toilets, parks, metros.


4. Continue to walk, run, do your fitness activities but maintain a huge gap from people.


5. Do NOT touch other people.
