So am not talking about eco-friendly equipment in gyms.


After more than 13 days of strictly working out at home, with no blocks, no bosu-ball (that I use a lot), no weights, I am relying completely on my yoga mat, stairs and filled water bottles. It's been fantastic. Am not missing the gym at all. I do miss the road a lot - the intoxicating runner's high and that 'me time'. But I get it - it's time to grow up. The world is reeling in a pandemic and there's much more to life than running. ( I reluctantly agree and simultaneously wonder what my fellow runner-writer Haruki Murakami would have to say at that).


Back to Fitness while staying at home: of course there is home cleaning, the squatting while mopping, dishes to be done, dusting ( unending) and of course if you are a parent with kids who seemed amazing as long as they went to school, then you are .................!!! Forgot to check - are you also working from home??? My sympathies!


This is my second attempt in this blog about getting back to fitness...sustainable fitness - here's my take on how to sustain whatever your fitness levels are:


1. Don't eat mindlessly - Nothing new! But don't!!! It won't show today or tomorrow, but it will gradually.
2. But let's say you do decide to eat mindlessly for a day or two - then I'll say well done! you are human after all. Now drink loads of water for the next couple of days and rework on your discipline.
3. Btw - Warm water with lemon does wonders. I can feel it. Am down 2 litres of warm water for the day and it's only 2 pm. Plus staying hydrated will make sure you don't sit on your bum for too long! The trips to La Loo will keep you moving!
4. I'll go back to point 2 - if you are buying your veggies on your own, cleaning, cutting and cooking them on your own - chances of you eating mindfully are low. Very low.
5. Do not consider home cleaning a full fledged workout. But act accordingly - How is this a lesson on sustainable fitness? Because once life looks up and it's back to normal, you will get your help staff in place again. Remember you need to sustain your fitness and not replace. So if you are used to a certain level of workouts - do them, modify the intensity depending upon your workload at home. But do it. If you worked out for 40 minutes before the lockdown, then do 20 now. But do it. Act accordingly.
6. I want to remind you that exercise and good diet is crucial. Do not take it for granted. Exercise looks physical, but I feel it's a spiritual balm for the body.
7. Get creative with your workouts. Think out of the box.


We are not what we look, we are what we feel about how we look! Keep working on that feel. It takes work.
