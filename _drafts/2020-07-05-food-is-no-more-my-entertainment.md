But it was before the lockdown. I have looked forward to trying out new restaurants, the ones that serve the best of this and the taste of that. Have looked forward to the big brunches on sundays as a treat to my 20+km runs. Many hours have gone by on you tube figuring out that moroccon delight the ingredients of which can be found only at the prime super market and the price of which was always heavy on my wallet.


Also, you've notivced  that food was the biggest entertainment for people around the world during the lockdown. Instagram, Facebook - became more like food porn websites.


Everyone was now cooking. Experiments galore in the kitchen.


I can't say exactly what happened right in the middle of the pandemic, but I wasn't fretting over food that much.


And then, India's migrant population going back to their villages during the pandemic happened!  The media shared images of  1000s of helpless, tired, broken, foodless, waterless, shelterless, shoeless, migrant kids, old women, men, men carrying their people walking hundreds of miles back to their villages after having lost their jobs and livelihood in the cities. Hugely disturbing images.


They impacted me. Privilege made me feel guilty. I felt the need to grow up.


Everything is related.


I felt a pull towards a simpler, lighter plate - the embellishments felt unpleasantly excessive.


Does that mean, I don't enjoy food. Absolutely nothing like that. I enjoy my family meals, simple home cooked meals. I love having chai with my mother - add a rusk to it and it's a party. I love making pizzas for my kids, summer shakes too. I want to share an occasional cheesecake with my loved ones. But do I look forward to these things often now - NO!


I look at food as a source of energy for myself now. I eat well enough to stay energetic, so I try to eat right. I run, so I want my food to give me power and there's enough power in home cooked simple meals.


I look at food in 3 categories now:


1. Essentials  - I need my daily dose of raw vegetables, carbs, proteins, water, one fruit, my dietary supplements, immunity boasting foods.
2. Non-essentials - The every other day suji halwa made at home, the poori-bhaji that makes me salivate but I don't need, the meat in my diet for which I CAN find vegetarian sources. ( no am not against non-vegetarian). Infact I am one myself.
3. Junk - processed foods - readymade sauces, cheese, bakery items bought from the market, the mithai bought from the market. My kids love it and we have a delivery nearly once a week.


But simple, powerful, nourishing food is not an easy practice. You have to be at it. It is easier to call for shit delivered by swiggy. Also way easier to spend a lot more money and eat out. Constantly preparing meals that don't have the extra is not easy - I have known this for a while and know it even better today. Simplicity is not easy. It requires huge effort.


The mind influences the food choices? The food choices we make influence our mind? I havn't cracked this one - but right now am at peace. Will this last forever ? Forever does not exist.
