Food is no more my entertainment. But it was before the lockdown. I have looked forward to trying out new restaurants, the ones that serve the best of this and the taste of that. Have looked forward to the big brunches on sundays as a treat to my 20+km runs. Many hours have gone by on you tube figuring out that Moroccan delight the ingredients of which can be found only at the prime super market and the price of which was always heavy on my wallet.


You noticed what happened during the lockdown? The world was cooking and posting on social media. REPEAT. EVERYONE. Suddenly - food came to the rescue to every human. It became pride,joy, love and life during lockdown.


And then, India's migrant population going back to their villages during the pandemic happened! The media shared images of 1000s of helpless, tired, broken, foodless, waterless, shelterless, shoeless, migrant kids, old women, men, men carrying their people walking hundreds of miles back to their villages after having lost their jobs and livelihood in the cities. Deeply disturbing images.


They impacted me.


- Privilege made me feel guilty.
- I felt the need to grow up.
- Right in the middle of a pandemic lockdown, food became an essential for me and almost seized being entertainment for me.
- I felt a pull towards a simpler, lighter plate - the embellishments felt unpleasantly excessive.


I look at food as a source of energy for myself now. I eat well enough to stay energetic, so I try to eat right. I run, so I want my food to give me power. Home cooked meals are energy bombs. I gave up non-veg through the lockdown period - don't ask me why - but I don't miss it. The mind influences the food choices? The food choices we make influence our mind? Tough one to crack. Will this last forever ? Forever does not exist.


Simple, powerful, nourishing food is not an easy practice. You have to be at it. It is easier to call for shit delivered by swiggy. Also way easier to spend a lot more money and eat out. Constantly churning out meaningful, light on the gut, energy delivering food requires effort. Simplicity is not easy.


Last year I did a short course on Everyday Nutrition by Stanford University - It turned out amazing! Being in the fitness field myself, some learnings were new to me. I practiced these with much more discipline during lockdown. Am fitter and more energetic.


You don't need a nutritionist or a dietician or a doctor to stamp these. Common sense along with knowledge is never not magic. So here we go:
