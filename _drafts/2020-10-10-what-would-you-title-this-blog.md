Many titles swarmed my head for this piece. Let me waste your precious time and take you through them.


10 Lessons Learnt from my 10 day 10k Running Streak!


Why I ran a running streak?


The benefits of a running streak.


etc. etc. etc.


I took up a run streak challenge for the first time in my 6 years of running! Running everyday is not what I have practiced simply because the idea never excited me despite a great deal of influence around. The images of everyday running conjured up a "tired", "unwilling", "getting stuck with my ego", "dragging myself out of bed" kinda Tanya images!


And then welcome Covid-19! The Greatest Pause in the history of mankind and Runners! India went under a strict 'lockdown'!  It was human against human! Covering every opening on the face with a mask became the new way of living. A national call came out - #stayhome #staysafe #stayin! Those hashtags, which I used for my instagram reach, were to be taken seriously if we wanted to live!


Coming back to running ! Of course, we weren't allowed to run - not on the roads or the parks or the tracks! Everything was under a strict curfew! But Runners love challenges and not being able to run in a pandemic was certainly a one of a kind thrown at them. And before you think that the tribe of runners gave up or sat back, let me remind you - Runners love challenges!!!! The solution was found quickly - Indoor Running or Running inside the house!!! Doing rounds of bedroom, living room, bathroom, store room and every 'room' in the house turned into a running track! Many did half marathons inside their 3 bedroom humble abodes!  Just wondering what the non runners in the family went through at that time!


Take my example - I was living with my parents in their house in Chandigarh. We have a 35-40 meter track around the lawn! After mocking all the Indoor runners for 2 weeks, I had had enough! It was time to run - wherever possible! I started running the home track max 2-3 kms! And then my mom complained - she was getting dizzy just 'watching' me run ROUND AND ROUND !!!! Sure, I am a trouble maker just by running!


Does it make sense to write 'long story short' when you've already given the long story? Long story short - the lockdown relaxed every passing week and I was back to good mileage on beautiful deserted wide roads but I was facing the first level of 'runner's tragedy'- Losing motivation!


Strava to the rescue! Checked out some of my fav runners feeds  - no motivation still! Overdozed on runner quotes - made me fall asleep! Watched Paula Radcliffe, Kipchoge's old running videos - inspiring but not enough to bring a spring in my step! What was happening to me? Why was this happening? Was this the end of my the self motivated runner in me! I was beginning to get dramatic in my choice of words at home and everyone said - it's just 'running'!!! No it's just not running! Damn, nobody gets it ......I frustratingly said to myself!


Then came in a man - and his running mission from Earth to Moon and back! His facebook status read - "only 20000 kms left from moon to earth"! It was my crazy coach - Alfredo Miranda! Next day - he sent me a whatsapp message - I am going to challenge you to a 10 day streak - I need you to help me finish some distance from Moon to Earth!


What?


I felt a jiggle in my belly! A butterfly flutter in my tummy!!! Sounds exciting - I said! But the monster was listening to it all and brought back that vision of me tired, bored, dragging myself came up again! The cynic in me said - How tough is it for you to do a 10k for 10 days? It's not tough! It's easy! Where's the challenge! You already know you can! No big deal!


I was about to pass on my cynicism to Alfredo and turned to open my whatsapp when I read the following messages:


"Don't just run to finish the next 10 days! Bring in your infectious energy into the 10k everyday! Run fast and sometimes as fast as you can!"


I smiled!"


I knew what Alfie meant - he was trying to remind me that my injury was long past me, I had been strength training hard enough and it was time to feel the magic I had been avoiding willingly - Running fast!


I suddenly felt driven! While excitement suffers ups and downs like the high and low after consuming refined sugar, feeling driven is definitely a different kind of sustainable high - the basis being its source - it comes from the self! And here I was standing on July 11th at the Sukhna Lake ready for the first 10k of my 10 day running streak!


The days went by each faster than the other -


And it was done! With energy! With a Will! I felt like a champion! Some of the paces I had hit were unbelievable for me! I had not taken up a fast run challenge for so long. And here I managed to run faster than my normal for whole 10 days!


Memories made! Lost motivation found! With a spring in her step, the runner is back embracing her long winding road knowing that the ups and downs will only make the journey more exciting and hoping that running and she would grow old together someday....
