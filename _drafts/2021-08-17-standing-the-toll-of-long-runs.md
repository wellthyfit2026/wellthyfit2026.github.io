I am a typical runner. I face the injuries. Fatigue comes knocking on my door often because am a bad sleeper. I love working out. Twice a day. I love chocolate.  I am lightweight. I build muscle very fast. I drop muscle faster.  Being over attached to running makes me feel the highs and lows even more ( Stoics, I envy you)! I feel the high after a fast run. I feel calm on my long runs. The lows come from the injuries – you have to be an unusual runner to not get injured in your running life.


Today, I want to talk about the long runs.


Somethings are hard to explain. Long slow distance runs are truly about finding a miracle in the mundane. [Read here](https://wellthyfit.com/running-why-long-slow-distance-is-great-for-good-running/), about how a runner once described it. runs are magic and more than are that.  Let me try:


Ive recently re-started my long runs! I have an easing plan that makes me run for 28 mins and walk for 2. Repeat for 120 minutes. Every Sunday.


In the last 4 months, I’ve gone from 45 mins to 60 mins to 90 minutes to 120 minutes. Walk and Run combinations.


That’s how it is after injuries. We ease into them.


I was scared if I would re-injure myself in the process again.


I was worried if I would be able to manage them solo, despite running solo for more than 2 years now.


I wasn’t sure if I would enjoy them.


But hey – Running is about learning to get bored. Peel layers of boredom till you learn to build a castle of endurance and perseverance. Beyond this castle, there is a hidden road to discovery. The road to discovery can be seen only when  you are moving with no thoughts of pace, time pressure, social media and strava pressure……it’s as simple as putting one foot after another, but not maybe as simple in practice.


But you already knew that?


And yet, the real toll begins after the run.


Recovery – food and hydration! – Put a link here


Rest – a nap helps! Widly! - here


Sleep – delicious! here


If none of the above happens – long runs take a huge toll on that body, the road to discovery becomes harder to find when am not recovered fully! But because hope dies last, you will do at least 2 of the above 3 properly and not all three because you are the usual runner.


But we learn. Every training season. Every year. Every Event. And most of us don’t give up. Such is the sport.
