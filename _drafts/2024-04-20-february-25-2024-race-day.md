I started writing my marathon training blogs back in January 2024 when I was 8 weeks away from the race. These 8 weeks came with a fair promise of intense training both by mileage and speed. I was excited! I was going to dive into a different kind of training for the marathon. I wanted to document each run and how I felt about it. I had hoped to take it to the end - till the race day. But as soon as I finished Week 3, my highest mileage week ever, I was ready to sleep for a whole week!!! I remember coming back home from my Sunday fast run and saying - I want a tent in the house - I don't want to be seen, someone just leave food at regular intervals outside my tent, leave me ginger tea twice a day and take my phone away for maybe 4 days and.........the only two peopel aloowed in my tent are my kids and that too only for hugs!
