**Tanya Agarwal**
![For the web](/assets/images/2016/08/For-the-web.jpg)

Tanya is a full time mom to 2 little ones, a self-proclaimed trekker, an avid runner and a propagator and practitioner of yoga. Always physically hyperactive but never particularly athletic, her take on fitness changed completely when she was carrying her first child and started dabbling with pre-natal yoga! She earned her degree in Marketing from NMIMS, Bombay and worked in the mainstream corporate world for about 5 years simultaneously following her passion for teaching.

She has been practicing yoga consistently for the last 6 years and running half marathons for the last 2 years. She is always looking for out-of-the-box ways of cardio, passionate about going back to the mountains at least 3-4 times a year and trying to get her headstand right! Slowly and steadily she is working her way up to earning some valuable credentials in the field of fitness.

 

**Ritu Govil**

She has been practicing different forms of Yoga for over 10 years and teaching yoga for the last 4 years. Her strength is regular practice and  she strongly believes in her Swami's philosophy that an ounce of practice is worth a ton of theory. Her one hour Vinayasa Flow sessions are a challenge even for the strength training regulars.
