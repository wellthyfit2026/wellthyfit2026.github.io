*My dear Yoga,*
*First and foremost, I need to clarify that you are not a mid-life crisis kinda thing to me!*
*This letter is about you and me and so I am not going to beg the world to do yoga or anything. Plus I also think that you are not meant for everybody. People have their own things to keep them alive and sparky. I think they should do more of that.*
*I was all of 30 when we first met! It wasn’t love at first sight either!  Even though I had heard about you, seen many people practicing you and talk about you, I didn’t have any reason to take you up. I was too busy living a fast life, going to the gym, and really from the look of it, you looked unachievable, sounded very spiritual and boringly spiritual.*

*In a very clichéd way, I write, that destiny had plans for us. We met when I was carrying my first born, at the pre-natal classes. It was a gentle tryst. It wasn’t about impossible postures. We had time to gradually know each other…I had 6 months to deliver my daughter and we met practically 3 times a week. And I started liking you. Being with you helped me with a smooth delivery and it was then I was convinced that I wasn’t going to break up with you after my first born. You had done some wonderful things to me in the last 6 months and I knew I had to now know you better and better. It was a realization that you weren’t just there for me on the mat, I could be with you anywhere.*

*We’ve been together for 6 years now! Through both my pregnancies, tough work days, screaming toddlers in the house, in ashrams around the world, in the hills, at the beaches.. I would be lying if I said that we’ve not had our breaking moments.  When I picked up running seriously, I thought I would get over you. But every time I come back to the mat, I can feel a little more excitement than getting my personal best or touching the finishing line. The vinyasa flow classes have left me invigorated enough to put my post-run high to rest.  No matter how much I tried to stay away by running a lot more, I have come back to a very accepting you – everytime.*

*You are not about impossible postures! You are not about getting 6 packs and you cannot be learnt from a book! I did make the cardinal mistake of investing some money buying books on you to know you more! But knowing you comes from being with you.*
*Even though there is the spiritual part of you that is spoken about highly, for me you stay fun and playful. It’s awesome how the stretches can bring me both joy and peace!**Unwinding a long day with you has been healing.*
*You’ve taught me balance! You’ve taught me nuances! You’ve taught me to synchronize! You’ve never left me breathless. Never left me with any pains, any aches or sores! After every challenging session with you, I have only felt redeemed!*
*You’ve taught me to understand my own breathe!*


# *Here’s to a lifetime with you, my dear practice…*
