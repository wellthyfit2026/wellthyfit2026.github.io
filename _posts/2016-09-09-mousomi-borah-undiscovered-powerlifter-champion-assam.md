All of 20, Mousomi Borah is a hidden, unseen pack of talent born and raised in the Assam.

![MB2](/assets/images/2016/09/MB2.jpg)To the uninitiated, she is a power-lifter who has participated in many national and international events of repute. Powerlifting consists of Squat, Dead lift and Bench Press.

Her latest accolades include being placed No. 2 at the Asian junior powerlifting championship held in Hong Kong! She won a Gold Medal for Squat (165kg) and Silver Medal for Bench Press (72.5kg) and Deadlift (130kg).

She started Powerlifting in 2011 and has never looked back on her love for this sport. She has been self-financing her participation in International events. Her family mortgaged 4 Bigha land at 10000 Rupees and her mother sold her jewelry. But this hasn’t deterred her from pursuing her dream and excelling!

She considers herself fortunate enough to not have found any sexual discrimination in sports. When she competes, she considers herself an athlete rather than a lady. She has full support of her family.

We wish her the best for her next big event - Training for Commonwealth Games to be held in Australia in 2018. In a somber tone she tells us the she couldn’t attend the last commonwealth games in India due to financial difficulties.
