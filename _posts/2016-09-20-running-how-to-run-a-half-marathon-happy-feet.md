### Running a half marathon is on most Bucket Lists.


It really is a big deal because you can never really fake one. Needs a training plan, consistent practice and commitment of time to slay this dragon. The takeaways – endless **BRAGGING RIGHTS** which will make you insufferable to your family, friends and strangers alike! Of course, other by products are fitness and an addiction to running!!

And the Mecca to crack this venerable goal is the Airtel Delhi Half Marathon. **This year’s Avatar of the ADHM is bigger than ever ! The tenth edition is called ADHMX (no prizes for guessing the obvious) !**Like last time,getting an entry into the haloed portals of Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium on 19 Nov 2017 is for the A-list of runners only. You need a timing certificate to apply – this weeds out the walkers who apply for a lark and brings about a seriousness amongst the ones who will run. Talk about killing two birds with one stone – WELL DONE Race Director!

The buzz is already there. The experienced ones have set their targets and started serious training. The new ones – got their timing certificates and are in a registering frenzy. Their questions are endless, Google is sick of answering their queries about running. Butterflies in their stomachs as they await confirmation with bated breaths. The awesomeness of the challenge will truly sink in once the confirmation arrives in the mail - **self doubts, lack of confidence. Welcome to the tribe.**

Rain check – running a half marathon is not about having a training plan and plugging away mile after mile. **HELL NO!!!!** It is about passion in the heart, fire in the belly, mind over mattress, it’s about physical pains which you never knew existed, it is about irritated family and friends, excitement of the buildup, the race day jitters and finally crossing the finish line looking **‘Oh So Cool’.**
