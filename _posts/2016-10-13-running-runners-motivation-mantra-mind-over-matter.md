**There is no such thing as bad weather only soft people.**

And you, the committed runner, are not soft. You will be out pounding the asphalt day after day. No impact of the cold, the call of the warm blanket or your family, friends, boss, etc,etc cribbing…….about weekends being spoilt by your running passion. You just smile and carry on because you are #madaboutrunning and you are victorious in the battle of mind over matter everyday…or should we say mind over mattress !!!!!

Mind over mattress ! No, it is not just about beating the early morning blues. It is a philosophy…a way of life.

**It Begins.**

It begins when you make an iron-clad commitment to fitness. It starts when you say no to late night Saturday parties or functions because you a have long run the next day. When you refuse the extra helping of dessert or the last drink for the road from your closest buddy. When you refuse to see the late night show with your better half (trust me – he or she IS JEALOUS of your love for running). The battle-drill starts when you shut-down the household early, set your running gear in order and set your alarm for 5 AM.

**It Happens.**

It happens when you refuse to hit the snooze button on your alarm clock at 5 AM. Your mind shuts out the devil who is shouting : it is too early,,,,just five more minutes, it is too hot, it is too cold. Your body, still stiff and tired, tries to defy you…..but you COMMAND it to move ! You WILL yourself to overcome ‘common sense’, ‘the comfortable’ and ‘the logical’. It begins when you tie your shoelaces and head out of the door before the sun rises. There is no looking back now. It happens when you wave a ‘Hi’ to your running buddies and start your pre-run warm-up. It happens when you take your first reluctant and slow steps till it becomes a rhythm. Till it becomes a symphony of breaths and the sound of your steps.

**It Delivers.**

It delivers when you get the runners high and finish your run feeling on cloud nine. A sense of accomplishment and satisfaction, a personal victory…..while the world still sleeps. An affirmation that you are made of STEEL and can overcome anything to achieve your goal. The banter and the post run chatter only adds to sense of well-being.

**This is just one runner day.**

The thing is, you will be faced with endless conflicts with yourself – fears, doubts, insecurities, responsibilities, duties, commitments. All trying to put a full-stop to your dream of running a successful half-marathon. The chorus becomes louder in the middle of the training program – half-way through but still some time for the big day. Sooooo easy to give in ! But remember you made a commitment. A commitment which cannot be faked. It needs a plan, sweat and perseverance. All your detractors are secretly jealous of you….because they know that your goal is big and they themselves are not up to it.

**Are you willing to give-in to your insecurities ? Is this the limit of your determination ? The nay sayers and nay doers are just waiting for you to fail.**

Winning in life or running a [half marathon](https://wellthyfit.com/running-improve-your-half-marathon-timing-four-off-beat-methods/) do not happen by luck or accident. Mind over matter or mattress is a choice – a choice to believe, “I will be better every day. I can and will strive to be faster, higher, stronger every day !”

The time is now. Make that choice – You have it in you to go the distance, to beat your fears and smack the nay-sayers in their face by action. **GO RUN !**
**“Every morning in Africa, a gazelle wakes up, it knows it must outrun the fastest lion or it will be killed. Every morning in Africa, a lion wakes up. It knows it must run faster than the slowest gazelle, or it will starve. It doesn't matter whether you're the lion or a gazelle-when the sun comes up, you'd better be running.”**
