I stick! I am finicky! I am stubborn about my running shoe brand! There is a certain brand and fit that works for me and I will not compromise till thy give up on the production – but then that’s for my shoes!

Running apparel is where the everyday fun lies! I am experimentative and look for new running apparel every now and then! Especially T-shirts! As a true-blue fashion runner, I have all kinds of running t-shirts in all sorts of colors sitting in my closet – long sleeves, racer-backs, halters – you name it!

The big sports brands are a no-brainer and have never gone wrong. It’s the Indian sports brands that I have been experimenting with and I’ve had my share of many disappointments and a recent win! So after 1 month, 13 runs, 3 cities, and many washes later -here I am ready to write a review on my interesting new find! My Tego Sweat Charged T-shirt.

The lesser known brand - TEGO! So when I have everything, why do I need a TEGO Running T-shirt?**Because it’s an absolutely no-nonsense, must have, I want a total comfort feel- kinda T-shirt!**
I did my first run inTego t-shirt in extreme humidity of about 88% -a long slow distance run and I wasn’t sure if it could hold the sweat well enough! But guess what!! Knock, knock!


1. It’s as comfortable as it gets! And that’s a first for me for my runs! And that’s where Tego did fantastic! No abrasive seam sewing and no chaffing post long runs! It’s a 100% mesh polyester hence it stayed smooth, light and flowy on the skin! ![img-20161017-wa0006](/assets/images/2016/10/IMG-20161017-WA0006.jpg)


1. It is true to its claim of wicking away sweat and controls odour. This feature is a USP with this running t-shirt by Tego.


1. I like the classic minimalistic look of the logo. It does not scream the brand which is something I admire about brands that are working so hard to make it!


1. It’s got more coverage than a lot of other running shirts. The sleeves are not too short. They are sized for comfort keeping everyday athletes in mind. It’s a no-brainer especially for a woman who runs in every city! It’s too basic, but it gives me the feeling of being safe no matter where I am running! It's functional T-shirt that you can’t go wrong with.


1. A good drying speed - we all know that better the breathability of a fabric, faster it dries! I washed 2 of my favorite running t-shirts and the new Tego Run t-shirt. Got each of the shirts dripping wet, hung them up next to each other, and checked every 40 minutes. I figured – it all depends upon the weather that day! Dries up as fast as the international brands!


**![hardworkshows_tego](/assets/images/2016/10/HardWorkShows_TEGO.jpg)A Surprise Fun Fact** : It was a plain blue t-shirt when I started running. Thick into the distance and sweat trickling down, I saw motivational words emerge from the fabric! It said faster, better and stronger! So you know when you are pushing yourself enough to sweat that’s when the motivational message appears!

**My verdict:** Tego Sweat Charged Running T-shirt is great and a superbly affordable running t-shirt in the Indian Sports apparel segment that almost any runner would be happy with!
