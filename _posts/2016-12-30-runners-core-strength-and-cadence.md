**How to run faster, longer while remaining injury-free ?**

…..and that Ladies and Gentlemen is the number one question (albeit in various forms) which bedevils the mind of a committed runner….and like Indiana Jones the quest for the answer takes them to many places – races, expos, training sessions, classes, books….Google is God, Youtube and endless gyan from experienced runners. So we at Wellthy.fit  put a gun to our heads and thought about what would be our New Year Tip to the committed runner to give a gamechanger answer to the eternal question. Bottom line upfront Mr/Ms Runner - focus on the two C’s : Core Strength and Cadence, to make dramatic gains. Somehow, these two check all the boxes : speed, stamina, running form, injury prevention… Max gains!

**What is the Runner’s core?** For a runner the core consists of the abdomen, back, pelvis and hips. The image from Apex Osteopathy is self-explanatory.

**How will a strong core help a runner?**The core muscles are the **FOUNDATION…THE POWERHOUSE…THE DRIVE** behind strong and injury-free running. A strong core translates into good running posture, more muscle power, balance and flexibility. The beautiful effortless running feeling as an integrated whole comes from a strong core. **Direct impact – faster and injury free running. Indirect impact –  greater stamina and endurance. Side effect – washboard abs**!

**How to develop a strong runner’s core?**Google the magic words, ‘Core strength for runners’ and it will bombard you with about 14,60,000 results. Routines, exercises galore for the beginner, intermediate and elite runner.  Some pointers :-


- Focus on core endurance and not core strength. Your core muscles must hold up for the entire run !

- Train the core as an integrated whole and not as an isolated muscle. Our preference – free hand exercises, pilates, yoga and Kettlebells for you gym rats.

- Brace yourself while training – act as if you are being punched while performing exercise to get best results.

- When – a few exercises to engage your core during your warm-up, conscious effort to run from the core, core building as a part of your post-run stretches and one dedicated core strengthening session per week.

- Try planks and glute bridges for 21 days – the results will surprise you.


![](/assets/images/2016/12/last-piece-2-1.png)**What is cadence?**Simply put, it is the number of steps per minute (spm). Elite runners typically have a cadence in-excess of 180 spm (Haile Gebrselaisse – 197, Meb Keflezighi – 203, Desiree Davilee – 194). Most beginner and recreational runners have an average cadence of 160 to 170. Use a runner’s watch or heart rate monitor to measure it or simply use a timer and count your spm.

**What is the ideal cadence?**The oft quoted Coach Jack Daniels book, ‘Running Formula’ puts it at 180 spm. While this magic number is being hotly debated on the internet, the fact remains that a 5% -10% increase in your cadence brings significant improvement in timings and injury prevention. It is **the ideal mix of high cadence and stride length which will bring best results**. That said, higher cadence is preferred over longer stride length due to reasons of endurance and injury prevention.**How will an increased cadence impact my running?**


- Injury Prevention - shorter strides leading to less impact forces and loading on joints.

- Improved Running Form – shift from heel strike to mid-foot strike.

- Easier to build up speed. Better running efficiency and lesser fatigue.


**How to increase running cadence ?**Google is your friend. Say hello and find your answers. Some tips :-


- Focus on smaller steps rather than running faster. Initially this will feel strange, but it will become natural with time (4-6 weeks). Intervals and downhill sprints are good for starters.

- Use a runners watch or smartphone based metronome to monitor the cadence while running.

- Use the correct arm-position. If your arms are too low it will be quite difficult to keep your cadence high.

- Lighter shoes – faster cadence.

- Build up your hip mobility and flexibility to permit high leg turn over. Look up for some great tips https://wellthyfit.com/hip-flexors-strengthening-yoga-runners/

- Focus on building your glute, hamstring, quad and ab strength. Our cheat sheet – explosive jumping squats and mountain climbers :- ![](/assets/images/2016/12/last-piece-2.png)


We at Wellthy.fit believe that the focus on improving your core strength and cadence will significantly improve the running of the beginner/recreational runner. **The challenge is in making it happen. If knowledge was everything, we would all be billionaire marathoners with six pack abs.** The two C’s are not very glamorous, initially uncomfortable with slow results. Stick with them to see dramatic results.

**You Can, You Will, End of story – Resolutions don’t last, self-belief does. Have a glorious 2017.**
