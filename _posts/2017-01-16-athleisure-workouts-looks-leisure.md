How many of us end up wearing our gym clothes to the grocery store, school runs, errands? Is it acceptable to wear athletic clothes all day long? I for one have realized that there are more yoga pants in my wardrobe than regular pants and the number of running jackets out do my regular wear. I am consistently found playing in the park with my kids wearing my yoga pants – they are comfortable, neat, colorful and fun! And then to save me from being called too lazy to get out of my gym or run gear post a session, there comes a trend to my rescue – Athleisure!

**What is Athleisure?**
*Wikpedia says* - **Athleisure** is a trend in [fashion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fashion) in which clothing designed for workouts and other athletic activities is worn in other settings, such as during work, casual or social occasions.  Athleisure outfits are [yoga pants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoga_pants), [tights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tights) and [leggings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leggings) that "look like athletic wear" and are characterized as "fashionable, dressed up sweats and exercise clothing". The idea is that gym clothes are supposedly making their way out of the gym and becoming a larger part of people's everyday wardrobes. By some accounts, the athleisure trend grew out of women wearing yoga pants.

Sadie Reid (an early pioneer in the British athleisure wear scene) says Britain had an unappealing attitude towards health, with the fitness industry overly focused on dieting, and spotted a gap in the market to reposition how Brits perceived sportswear – *The Telegraph*
**Athleisure is a Unisexual Trend** -**Hoodies, tailored Joggers, Sweatshirts/Jackets** – Cuts, styles and colours galore here! There is a range of in dry fits, running jackets, featherweight jackets, trekking jackets and basically uneding options! From light to extremely warm – there is more for everyone! I stopped going to Benetton, Tommy Hilfiger and even Zara! They are boring, same and no fun colors!

**Sneakers are in. Heels are out** – Infact running trainers are really in! A visit to any Nike and Adidas store will show you a range of beautiful sneakers that can be worn with complete style, with regular pants, shorts, skirts etc . Much more comfy, stylish and really heels are so not in – so say the fitnessistas!

**Doesn’t really matter if you plays sports or not –**All you have to do is look fit (better is to stay fit)! You could be a chess player and still wear sporty clothes and completely redefine the way you play board games! Look sporty no matter what you are doing! Athleisure can be fun accessorized too – the girls can wear loops, long chains.

Even though the trend is big in the US, in India one can see just hints of it!. There is a large population in the metros trying to stay fit and look good! It’s just a matter of time when they will incorporate activewear in their daily attire! Look fun, colorful, trendy and most importantly – Sporty!
