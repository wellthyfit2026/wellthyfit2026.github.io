15 days back I came across the term and I have been practising them ever since. Google says they are called the Fountain of Youth because the 5 sequences emit energy in our body! I thought this is exactly what is called divine intervention! Winters don't bring out my very best and I feel low on energy - so I just knew it that I had to give the 5 Tibetan Rites a good try and really see if they infuse some energy in me!

**What is the Five Tibetan Rites?**According to Wikipedia - The **Five Tibetan Rites** is a system of [exercises](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exercise) reported to be more than 2,500 years old[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_Tibetan_Rites#cite_note-Eye-1) which were first publicized by Peter Kelder in a 1939 publication titled *The Eye of Revelation*.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_Tibetan_Rites#cite_note-Kelder2-2)The Rites are said to be a form of [Tibetan yoga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trul_khor) similar to the [yoga series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoga_series) that originated in [India](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India). However, the Five Rites and traditional Tibetan yoga both emphasize "a continuous sequence of movement" (Sanskrit: [vinyasa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vinyasa)), whereas Indian forms focus on "static positions".

**How to practice them?**
**Rite 1 –  Clockwise spin -![](/assets/images/2017/02/Tibetan-article-0.jpg)**
**Takes you into a beautiful but dizzy trance. Like most things in life, you really need to experience this and gradually this madness will be a mood changer for you. As of now I can manage about 7 :)**


- Stand with your arms outstretched palms facing down with arms outstretched

- feet hip distance apart

- focusing on any spot in front of you

- breathe in and breathe out as you spin

- go round and round till you get a bit dizzy in your head.

- We need to gradually increase the number of spins from two to 21.


Finish the number of repetitions you have set for yourself and relax a few seconds before you move to the next rite.

**Rite 2: Work that core 21 times (always build up gradually)  ![](/assets/images/2017/02/tibetan-article-7.jpg)**


- Lie flat on the floor

- legs straight

- your arms to your side palms down

- keep your fingers together

- As you inhale deeply through your nose, lift your legs and head simultaneously, tucking your chin into your chest.

- Keep your legs straight and try to extend them towards your head.

- Slowly exhale, lowering your legs and head to the floor, keeping your knees straight and your big toes together.


- Finish the number of repetitions you have set for yourself and relax a few seconds before you move to the next rite.


**Rite 3: Third Rite: Kneeling Backbend - Awesome for all those who kill the day typing on the phone. ![](/assets/images/2017/02/Tibetan-Article-1.jpg)**


- Kneel on the floor with your spine straight, legs together, toes curled.

- Place your hands on the backs of your thigh muscles

- Tuck your chin against your chest

- As you inhale *deeply through your nose,*raise your head up and lean back

- Bring your shoulder blades together

- your head and neck go backwards. Stay comfortable.

- support your weight with your hands against your thighs.

- You then start exhaling as you return your head to the start position.


Finish the number of repetitions you have set for yourself and relax a few seconds before you move to the next rite.

**Rite 4 – Table Top - Amazing work on the wrists ![](/assets/images/2017/02/Tibetan-article-3.jpg)**


- Sit down on the floor with your legs straight out in front of you. Feet slightly apart.

- Place your palms on the floor alongside your sitz bones.

- Drop your head back gently

- As you breathe out, raise your buttocks off the floor and get your torso straight while bending your knees.

- Your torso and your thighs should be straight and parallel to the floor.

- Let your head go back as much you can.

- As you breathe in, return to your sitting position. Remember to bring your head forward.


As you stand up, let your muscles relax a few seconds and breathe deeply before moving to the Fifth Rite.

**Fifth Rite: Pendulum - If you can imagine yourself doing this 21 times (always build up gradually) then you are as fit as you can get!**
**![](/assets/images/2017/02/IMG_8958-1.jpg) ![](/assets/images/2017/02/Tibetan-Article-4.jpg)**


- Get down on the floor in push-up position

- Keep your hands and legs a little less than shoulder-width apart.

- Exhale as you get into the upward dog movement

- You should try to not let your body touch the ground except for the curled toes and hands. But it’s completely fine if you do.

- As you inhale, move into the downward dog pose.

- Then again as you inhale, return to your starting position (upward dog movement).


After you have completed the Five Rites, lie flat on the floor on your stomach with your arms stretched out from side to side. Keep your eyes closed and stay as relaxed as you can.

It detoxifies, rejuvenates, recharges and brings your most jumpy self out! The vibrations in the body while doing them go a long way in the 24 hours ahead of you!

It’s amazing how can never and really never, stop learning! So vast is the field of fitness!
