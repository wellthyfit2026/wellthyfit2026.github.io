***Shamelessly lifted! Unabashedly modified! But Beautifully Scripted*** .......from the original 'Can't Stop the Feeling' by the venerable Squire Justin Timberlake! Only a heart runner can perfectly fit his love for running in his music! The perfect Valentine's day special for all the Runners out there!


***I got this feeling inside my bones***
***It goes electric, wavey when I turn it on***
***All through my city, all through our run***
***We're flying up, no ceiling, when we are in our zone***


***I got that sunshine in my pocket***
***Got that good soles on my feet***
***I feel that hot blood in my body when we run***
***I can't take my eyes off it, you move so phenomenally***
***Rock and Run, Run and Rock, so don't stop***


***And under the sun when everything goes***
***Nowhere to hide when I'm getting you close***
***When we run, well, you already know***
***So just imagine, just imagine, just imagine***


***Nothing I can see, but you, when you run, run, run***
***A feeling so good creeping up on us***
***So just run, run, run, come on***
***All those things I shouldn't do***
***But you run, run, run***
***And ain't nobody leaving soon, so keep running***
***I can't stop the feeling***
***So just run, run, run***
***I can't stop the feeling***
***So just run, run, run, come on***


***Ooh, it's something magical***
***It's in the air, it's in my blood, it's rushing on***
***I don't need no reason, don't need control***
***I fly so high, no ceiling, when I'm in my zone***


***And ain't nobody leaving soon, so keep running***


***Everybody run (I can't stop the feeling)***
***Got this feeling in my body (I can't stop the feeling)***
***Wanna see you move your body (I can't stop the feeling)***


***Got this feeling in my body, come on***


***Can't stop the feeling***


Happy Running!
