Resistance band Workouts! Phenomenal stopgap to fill in the voids for those days when you have no access to the gym or in my case, the road (runner talking). **This Video is complete by itself for a Do it Along workout!**
**Benefits:**


- Builds strength in the legs without the wear and tear of the joints and hips.

- Even though bands help you to work on muscular endurance, you can easily combine cardio with it

- You can work on the entire body while you split the areas into- Legs, Shoulders, Chest, Back, Arms, Core

- you can combine and make your own circuit with the band but always remember to warm up before


**Equipment you need:**


1. A good Resistance band - available on amazon and any decent sports shop.

2. A good workout Mat / Yoga Mat


**In this Video, focuses on the sitting and lying down exercises which focus on strengthening the glutes and lower body! The exercises demonstrated are:**


- Glute Kickbacks

- Lying Hip Abductions

- Elbow Hip Abductions

- Leg Raises

- Double Leg Raises


You can do each exercise 10 times with 3 reps

**Always remember:** To keep your core/abdomen tight, your butts contracted and you have to be breathing well. take 20 seconds off between each set! Let's start band-ing!
