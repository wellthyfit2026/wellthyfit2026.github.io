A big hello to Moms, Running Moms, Weight-Training Moms and basically all the happy active moms out there!

While we all do enough cardio excercise reducing the layer of fat, especially around our lower body - what really does the trick for a healthy body is not just fat reduction but also a strong, toned body that come with toned muscles! Which basically means working your inner and outer thighs, hamstrings, and butt helping you feel strong and look leaner!

So Seema (my guest workout partner) and I, worked on 9 various exercises to pack in a great butt, hips and hamstring toning workout! Always remember to listen  to your body - if it hurts bad - you know that you have to stop. If it's just feeling too hard, then you know that you are making it work!

And while there are millions of videos on Youtube to help you battle the lower body toning wars, hopefully this is another great effort by two moms to help you stay fit!

Breathe in, Breathe out - Mommy - Take Charge of your Health!
