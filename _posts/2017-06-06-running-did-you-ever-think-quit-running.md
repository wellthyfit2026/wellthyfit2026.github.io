### Did you ever want to quit running? Does that ever cross your mind?


I met up a runner friend who has been running for a long time and became my friend very recently. When she told me that she wanted to quit running sometime back, it took me a while to comprehend the depth of what she was trying to say. She’s been a podium finisher for a while now, so would she want to quit running? Why would that even cross her mind???


### **The question stays with me**


I asked myself this question, and there came a few more…


- Did you ever want to quit running for some months or really quit it forever?

- And then, Did you?

- And when you did – did you give up on your decision and get back to it?

- Was it lack of sleep? Tired?

- Was running stressing you out?


I know I won’t quit running because I am bored, or because I am lazy or because my knees hurt. Maybe a serious injury might ask me to find my high in another sport. I like the challenge Running throws at me mentally and physically. Being able to figure those challenges, overcoming them, running with my run buddies, sometimes alone, - it's a panoply of reasons that will get me back on the road!

I also came across this wonderful article on the Telegraph. What happens when a runner gives up running? [Click here](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/men/active/11738315/What-happens-when-a-runner-gives-up-running.html)
