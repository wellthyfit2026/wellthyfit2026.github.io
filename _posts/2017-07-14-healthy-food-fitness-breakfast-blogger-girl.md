#### **I am a big breakfast person!**


That’s my longest, most cheerful and sometimes also the biggest meal of the day (the perks of working from home). I have a young girl who helps me in the morning and we get by doing simple, tasty and meaningful healthy food. You would realise as you go by this blog - am no where close to the terrific job the true food bloggers do, but putting my breakfast down in a blog, taking pictures, showing all that I eat - makes my feel like a true blue fitness blogger! So here's to the feeling!!!

Sharing some very simple, easy to do stuff that I do very often! I eat just about everything and keep my portions slightly big. My breakfasts are filling and keep me off my next snack for at least 2 to 2.5 hours. Anything lesser than that and I feel I didn't do justice to my brekka! I also like Idli Sambhar, Dosa, sausages etc. But these are kept to once a week - and out of home, Sunday brunch kinda thing.

But here's some more!


### **Fruit -  Loads of Fruit + 2 whole eggs + A glass of steaming hot milk + Almonds (soaked overnight)**

To top this if you worked out that morning – you need your protein for sure. So I add the eggs and because I love hot milk  (my comfort food)– I add that too.


### **Sautéed veggies with bread + Egg + A glass of mango shake**

Plus it’s filling and who doesn't love the flavour of a runny yolk. I usually have two of these (thank you god for making eggs edible) Plus you have a long day to go by – if you are active – then what’s to worry. I sautee some veggies, stuff my bread with it. Grill it very slightly. I still need my fruit, but I need something cold with it. So I make a curd and mango smoothie! Filling!


### **Chillas stuffed with Veggies + Fruit Smoothie**

This I had mentioned in my last post. Click [here for the recipe](https://wellthyfit.com/fitness-healthy-millets-protein-active-people/) and all that you want to know about the goodness of millets. – I do for dinner and for breakfast. Full of protein, fibre and I stuff it with veggies too. Layer it up with homemade mint chutney, sautee whatever veggies you like or in season, roll it up and gobble it down. I eat about 3 of these for breakfast.  Also add a fruit smoothie ( for me right now, it means only Mango :)


### **Sprouts + Almond milk shake (cold)**

Never never never underestimate the power of these tiny ones! Packed with fibre and protein –  tasty and can be done in so  many ways.  Sometimes I’ve had them thrice a week. But I eat large portions – because my aim is not to lose weight.  Infact for me- this has to be the most filling meal of the day.  Add tomatoes,  parsley/coriander, onions and some mint chutney too along with salt! Easy – peasy! Your body will thank you. I have a cold almond milk shake after eating that.


### **Sautéed veggies with a big bread + Glass of Milk + Almonds**

This is just fresh bread along with some veggies! Simple! Saute the veggies in some light olive oil (I use mustard oil, mostly), some fresh parsley or corriander, salt, you could also add some grilled chicken shreds, and then just stuff it in the bread and ready to eat! I sometimes finish the whole loaf ( long run days) but on regular days - half is good. Plus a glass of hot steaming milk never goes wrong for me!

As Ron Swanson says "


> There has never been a sadness that can't be cured by breakfast food! (Can't agree enough)


I would just add to that :


> There has never been a sadness that can't be cured by thoughtful, well -meaning, clean breakfast food!


Before the realists attack and say - it's just breakfast - there's more to life, well here's wishing you all one morning after another of good hearty cheerful brekkas with friends, family and fun strangers!
