***I can never last the 100 days of Running Challenge. I have 100 excuses to not take it up. But actually my biggest reason is that I have commitment issues. Clearly the world on my facebook is getting more daring and more committed, year after year. This year I felt that this challenge was spreading like fire on Facebook! It's also a no-brainer on why taking up the 100 Days of Running Challenge is well intertwined with Facebook! In a good way! Because announcing it on Facebook - let's people cheer you, the peer pressure ultimately brings in the discipline and it holds you accountable to your challenge!***
***With so much goodness to this challenge, is there something we are missing? Does it give injuries, is it too much on the runner's family, what about recovery? So I got my questions listed down and sent to Bijay Nair who as been the Social Media Heartthrob of this challenge to send me his honest and truthful answers!***
**Has 100 days of Running made you a Run addict?**
**Bijay** - It’s a tricky question , I have been running for 10 years plus and also when I was in Armed forces. For me 100 days turned me in to more disciplined runner albeit without any training schedule . Rather than saying Run Addict , I would say Running became a Habit .

**Does it not lead to injuries? Isn’t that the biggest fear behind this? I mean if one stuck to doing the mandatory 2 kms, then maybe it’s ok, but beyond that?**
**Bijay-**Being a experienced runner , the plunge towards 100days was very thought over decision . I have my close circle of friends and there was a mix reaction from them too .  Injuries to be very frank , I recovered from my heel pain of 3 years with GAIT change during this 100days . It did reverse effect on me .

But for anyone taking this plunge needs to assess themselves . My advise would be assess yourself before committing to something like this . It requires a whole lot of dedication . Yes in my 100days I had only one injury scare to my plantar , it was more because of my landing in a pothole .

**What about recovery?**
**Bijay-**Recovery is a very important factor and am a firm believer in recovery . My biggest weapon was the Foam Roller , I use to do foam rolling often . At weekends I use to take my sports massage without fail . My therapist Prashant did a great job .

Challenge was when I use to miss my morning runs and then I had to run in the evening followed by run next morning .  Stretches and yoga was another great way to recover . I have known friends who didn’t take care of the same and had to forego the 100days of running .

Plus , Navy training has taught me many quick recovery methods .

**How big a role does Social Media have in making this a phenomena? Isnt it the only reason people actually sign up for 100 days of running? If Fb wasn’t there for the adulation, would people still do it?**
**Bijay-**Hmmm….. yes social media is the biggest change . It has its positive and it has its flip side too . You know what I am running from many years and those times when orkut was the only social media platform . I have been running 9 days 9 colors 9kms run from almost 10 years when I was not even known on social media . But yes , as you said it does have impact . Because of being a runner author and promoter of running , I did enjoy posting my runs on social media . I use to post my runs mostly on Running forum only and not even on my wall .

But yes , I believe if I post my runs which is honest  on social media then what is wrong in it . I believe anyone who is  social media savvy and post that 2 to 10 kms , still takes that effort to move their arse and run , so what is wrong in posting . Am sure it will motivate atleast 01 person .

But yes , if people follow you , there is always the peer pressure.

**Does it become a chore?**
**Bijay-**Instead of chore or addiction , let me use a better word “ Habit” . After 20 days your body , mind and soul amalgamate to take you through . I firmly believed , if it was only for the sake of doing I would have never did that.

**Were there days you felt you couldn’t it anymore? Or were travelling and you wished that you didn’t have to do this?**
**Bijay-**Yes ,atleast 5 times during this 100days . I am a working professional and I head a department , so my professional commitments are huge . My travel season is ,mostly May, June , July . Couple of days I had to run at wee hours in dark and once at airport . It did feel crazy , but sometimes craziness is fun , isn’t it .

My biggest challenge was running on 99th and 100th day , since I was going through a family crisis . I am blessed to have a lovely family who supported me through this 100days .

**How did your family cope up with it? did this test their patience sometimes?**
**Bijay-**Not at all , my family has been very supportive . My wife , my both brothers are runners , my mom is a exsportswoman , my dad is a fitness enthusiast and my lovely daughter she too supported my run . But yes at times , they were worried , when I had a low BP scare due to my thyroid level changing.

**What would you tell people about the nutrition needs?**
**Bijay-**Since , I was running an average 8kms per day I was very particular about my food and nutrition . I freaked on eggs, legumes, chicken  and pulses. I lost 7kgs in this 100days , my thyroid level altered from hypo to hyper , that never happened in 10 years of having thyroid. Nutrition is important , I use to have Fast and Up protein and reload/recover during my runs .

**What is your over all analysis to this 100 days of Running? Made you a better runner? Or a better human being? Will you do it again? Is once enough? Would you recommend it to everyone?**
**Bijay-**Believe me I became a more commited and dedicated runner . I valued my time . I improved drastically as a runner . I did two personal bests in two of the toughest races of india and am glad that I did 100days. Nevertheless , I will not run again since it requires a  huge commitment . Since my work profile entails whole lot of work pressure , commitment going forward is a question .

**Your deepest learnings on running because of 100 days of running?**

Trust me , I found me as a runner . I reached a zone , where I needed nobody to run with me , it was my body , my soul, my breath and my steps . I became a better runner . As Murakami says “I Run Therefore I  am “
