## *Nothing teaches you to appreciate the magic of everyday life like being in a new place and doing what makes you feel at home ...*


I sit through a peaceful time in a very quiet part of Udaipur on the eve of my 38th birthday to write this blog.

I call myself a Yogini not because of a few stretches am getting better at or because I talk about breathing.

It's because after 8 years of some non-serious and now serious and dedicated hours of everyday practice - taking out time for Yoga  feels effortless.... I won't call it a routine. I'll call it coming alive and feeling excited and sometimes nervous to do a few surya manaskars, or practice my warrior poses. Or just breathing exercises. I roll back the mat with satisfaction and a bit of pride - that I managed to fit in my practice - place, time and situation regardless.

While on my travels, I give myself a few pointers as I practice Yoga:


1. I don't miss doing Surya Namaskars everyday. And that could be my only physical activity for the day, given all the sight-seeing and exploration, am excited about in a new place. I do them slow and hold my poses to keep my body strong!

2. Don't obsess over difficult poses. I try to perfect what I know and push my holds longer!

3. Happy to do Yoga for just even '20 minutes'. When done properly - 20 minutes is great to energize me

4. Try to get one of my kids to come out and do Yoga with me. It's a vacation and why not! My daughter usually joins me! I feel thrilled!

This is my first visit to Udaipur! I came out to celebrate a quiet and bright Diwali. I chose to stay in [Ramada Udaipur Resort and Spa](http://www.ramadaudaipur.com/) over all heritage properties for three reasons - It looked so spacious and big - great to spread my mat anywhere (they have a great running track too - if you love the hills i.e.), my kids can enjoy the luxury of running around and it's a bit away (yet not far) from the madness of the city!

And it has been true to its digital image! I spread my mat three out of 5 mornings...there were spaces and places within the hotel premises for me to enjoy Yoga wherever I wanted!

As I get ready to run a 15k solo run tomorrow, sharing some pictures of my morning practice all within the Hotel premises, some facing the Monsoon Palace right on top of the hill, some between pillars giving me the perfect hip flexing and a beautiful bridge..
