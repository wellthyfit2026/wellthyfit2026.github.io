**This piece is NOT a sports-bra review. It is about SPORTS BRAS!**
![](/assets/images/2017/10/AR-yoga-session-3.jpg)I recently did a Yoga Session for Adidas Runners.  And I decided to do it in a Sports Bra! I have always felt fit and I don't have body image confidence issues! ! But something stopped me all this while which faded away that morning!

Was it the right sports-bra (I was wearing a Stella McCartney Adidas Sports Bra- which was gifted to my by my friend Supriya - who agrees that active women live more in sports bra than anything else), don't care and do your thing attitude? or was it just me?? Can't pin point one reason - but maybe this is how changes happen - ONE FINE DAY!

When it comes to the right sports bra - Trial and Error is the name of the game!

![](/assets/images/2017/10/suptavirasana-Ar.jpg)When I try one...I jump, run in the fitting room itself! Sadly the Indian staff is just not evolved/ trained enough to see a woman in a sports bra running in the store! Or wish they just had a treadmill installed to run with the sports bra on and see how it works for us! It always take a several trials to find the right one! It's a huge time investment but the one you shouldn't try to escape!

***Different activities do require different kinds of sports bras:***

Running requires you to wear a supportive bra that compresses and encapsulates! Yoga is low impact activity and can be done with a less supportive bra. Cycling again is not very high impact activity! Just remember - finding the right one will take time an you have got to keep looking till you say -  I feel confident and fabulous!


#### I spoke with 5 active woman -who swear by how much time they spend in their sports bra and this is what they had to say about their inner tight hugging best support friend:

#### *The bra should minimize the breast movement. It should not twist when you move. One should also ensure that it provides proper support. To top it all ... if it’s colourful & vibrant .. you feel beautiful too*

#### *For me every place starts chaffing on a run that is longer than km 25. Even the otherwise best sports bras. So I have mastered the art of Vaseline all over. I definitely prefer sports bras that don’t have any hooks or buttons behind as that area then chaffs even in my small runs. It’s good for the sports bra to be snug but not choking snug.*

#### *Good hold though not very flat so basically cup sizes, soft at edges with adjustable straps, moisture wicking fabric most important!!!*

#### *One that has good support because I am busty and doesn't chaff on long runs. And of course looks pretty, if I decide to take off my t shirt and run only with my sports bra and shorts*

#### *Easy to wear and take off. Correct fit to be supportive without squeezing. Non-chafing. Breathable. If it is like a crop top, then it is a bonus. Also, I prefer lightly, firmly padded ones.*

#### ***I want breathability, no rubbing or chafing around arm holes, straps, seams, hooks, clasps or anything else. I  jump up and down, jog in place, and see how good a hold it has!***


### **I'll quickly list down a few issues you need to watch out with your Sports bras:**


**You haven't changed your bra in 6 months**

The life of a sports bra is about six months to a year.  And then - the material is stretched, which basically means that it won't be good enough to provide the same level of support. Plus I do think - our bodies change! The changes may not be drastic but it's important to hit the stores and look for what goes best with your current shape.

**Your sports bra is giving dents in your shoulders**

Check if your straps leave dents in your shoulders, because if this is happening even after adjusting them - then your band is too big. It also means you are depending too heavily on your bands which would eventually make your shoulders hurt. A good crossback sports bra is the answer for such an issue. However most women end up thinking that they are top heavy. But more often than not - that is not the reason, because there are sports bras and sizes for every body. We just have to find the right fit.

**Your straps are too short or thin**

One rule - the bigger your chest - the wider your straps should be! Properly fitting straps decrease pressure on neck and shoulders and prevent uncomfortable chafing.

**Your sports bra does not have the sweat-wicking feature:**


I ran heavily through a long, brutal, humid summer! and I won't have managed to survive it had it not been a  breathable, sweat-wicking fabric! It should absorb the sweat without making you feel like a sponge!

After 3 years of active running, and many hours of browsing through the internet, trying various styles and brands in malls in and out of India, I understand that finding the right sports bra is a personal battle. Don't go and splurge your money because of a review you read, go try it and go try some more. Jump up and down in the fitting room, do some burpees there! And still nothing can ensure you picked the right one! Brace yourself yet again but keep looking! :)
