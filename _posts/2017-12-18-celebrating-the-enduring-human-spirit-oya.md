I’ll start with playing defensive here. Good deal of thought has gone into deciding to write this review. Most of you would just thrash me asking what does this post have to do with running? I mean – nothing about speed, personal best, tempo, intervals, nutrition and hydration, running zen, course management, NOTHING technical or informative! Then why?

Because 6 months back – I, who doesn’t like to wear even her wedding ring, purchased 3 beautiful running charms from a 'one if its kind' Fitness Jewellery outfit by the name of [Oya](http://www.oyaindia.com). On some further scratching, I spoke to the The woman behind it, Sandhya Balasubramanian, a runner herself. She was inspired to start the brand when she realized that nothing like this was available in India. Her thoughts - a little positive and inspiring jewelry can actually get you out of bed at times! Its not just a shiny bauble but represents a piece of who you are.

***And so I like - A runner, a gym freak - starts her own active jewellery brand!***

Of course, she is perfectly capable of being her own cheerleader, but then gifting her one would be make it even more special!

**But before I continue to make the blunder of stereotyping Oya’s Fitness/Active jewelry for women only, I must declare that they are 'Unisex' pieces.****I am open to the debate**, but in the realm of fitness, , there are many things ‘unisex’! Both women and men use the same kettlebells, same machines in the gym and run the same road!

Wearing fitness charms, pendants, as common as they are outside India, are more of lifestyle choices! The world’s popular athletes don them, infact most of their fitness jewelry defines them. Serena Williams is one big example. Some of the world’s best wear charms with the thought of staying motivated, focused and having a sense of belonging. Kelley O'Hara, Olympic soccer gold medalist wears two necklaces for every game. And am not talking about the gold chains worn by NBA men. [Check out the ease](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2180129/Past-Olympic-Athletes-Legends-fell-earth--Bankruptcy-shoplifting-adultery-disgrace.html) at which these past Olympic athletes wore their favorite charms, pendants on their games!

![Novak Djokovic - WellthyFit - Oya India](/assets/images/2017/12/novak-djokovic.jpg)**In India, something holds us back.** We mix it with performance, in a negative way. We easily bash them by saying – ‘he/she is more concerned about how they look, than perform!’ Baseless as that statement is, I am a recreational runner, and I have recently found a certain attachment to my fitness charms and pendants.

**I wore a small charm for ADHM and now as I train for Tata Mumbai Marathon (TMM),** I will be wearing another charm for that event. Somehow – the memories attached now are just not with the medal. After the ADHM, I took my medal off but had the neck charm on for the whole day. Among my medals, my certificates, this running girl charm is a treasured piece.

I hope I managed to make a level playing field here, removed the stereotypes attached to women and jewellery!

**And here we go taking a look at those little gifts that salute someone’s enduring spirit -**
