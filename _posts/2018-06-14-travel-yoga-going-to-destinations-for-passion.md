4 years back, after spending considerable time learning Yoga…I decided to take the plunge on travelling for Yoga! Bali, Cambodia, Mysore etc etc I thought, And then like an epiphany…I decided that if it’s Yoga – then why not Rishikesh???

The yoga Capital of India!

**So here I was – on a solo travel to Rishikesh! To do what – Just [Yoga](https://wellthyfit.com/yoga-benefits-of-yoga-importance-of-yoga-in-our-lives/)!!! For how many days – 15! And why, again – just Yoga!**
**It was one of a kind adventure** – I set out for a journey of which I had no pre-conceived notions! Booked an ashram through a friend. Aim was to learn more yoga, work on postures and immerse myself completely into the practice.

![](/assets/images/2016/11/IMG_0314.jpg)**Rishikesh is mind-blowing**. The number of ashrams, yoga institutes, the yoga acharyas – are nothing short of worth making trips every weekend! At one point I was convinced that I should buy a small house in Rishikesh. The food offered at various restaurants even outside the ashrams is for health lovers. Inlike Haridwar, the crowd belongs to a different world here...there are yoga punks, serious yogis, wannabe yogis, you name it!

 

![](/assets/images/2016/11/IMG_0221.jpg)![](/assets/images/2016/11/MG_8029.jpg)**You meet beautiful strangers and learn endlessly** – [Yoga Niketan](https://www.yoganiketanashram.org/) (the ashram where I stayed) is a favorite with the Japanese. My Iyengar yoga classes with Usha devi were like entering a kaleidoscope! Amongst her 40 students, I was the only Indian! There were yoga instructors from around the world who had come to grill themselves under the guidance of a great Iyengar teacher. Meeting some of them, a lunch with some, a chai with another few – to me they were all Monks who sold their Ferraris - but these were Yoga Monks! Consultants – who left stressful jobs to teach yoga around the world,  fluid like chinese women who came to become even more fluid…and I met an old lady who was travelling India on her Bullet and was in Rishikesh to learn Yoga for a month! My practice had found a new meaning.

 

![](/assets/images/2016/12/IMG_20161208_164607.jpg)![](/assets/images/2016/11/IMG_0241.jpg)**There is magic beyond the comfort zone** – So far I travelled far and wide to explore cities, mountains, beaches! And here I was sitting in the yoga-land! I took the challenge. I DIDN'T HOLD MYSELF BACK! Doing 6-7 hours of Yoga Only! Sleeping on a wooden bench, in a small room of a 100 year old ashram, meeting strangers from all over the world, learning from them, admiring their passion towards something that came from India! BOOM – I am new! Vivacious! New surroundings, new food, new people, and new opportunities for self - discovery! I woke up at 4 am everyday, went for a class on mediation in the pitch dark, ate with the ashram members and headed out to various other ashrams to learn more Yoga. It was a disciplined living every minute of the day.  I talked much lesser, walked a lot through the streets of Rishikesh sometimes 9-10 kms a day, and for most part after yoga, spent afternoons in my room surrounded with mango trees....living a tale that I can recount to my kids many times.

You come back home to your family as a happier person, ready to take life head on, you become a better person and more contended too.

I plan to take such a trip again, to another yoga destination somewhere in India which has many hidden gems, amazing teachers and a crowd full of learners from around the world!
