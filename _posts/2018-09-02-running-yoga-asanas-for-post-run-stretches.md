The post-run Yoga asanas or stretches pull out the muscle soreness from every nook of the system, stretch the areas that need special attention after running and leave an injury-free runner. Post-run, we usually end up foam rolling (which is great) and do some very basic post run stretches and repeat them to a level where there is no challenge left in getting a good stretch!

So here are some post-run yoga asanas with a twist and inverted action to bring about some fun in your stretches.


#### The Twisting Lunge


One of my new favorite [post-run](https://wellthyfit.com/post-run-recovery-the-runners-ace-of-spades/) stretch since and a yoga asana that targets most of the major leg muscles (except the calf muscle). This pose will stretch out your hip flexors, quads, glutes, obliques, and even your chest provided you make an effort to make a good torso rotation in the twist.

#### Rocking the Baby Pose (Hindolasana)


Beautifully relaxes the lower body post a long run. Please avoid this yoga asana if you have a hip or knee injury. It's a gentle stretch, no hard beating, doesn't require much flexibility, stretches the calves, quads and brings in blood circulation since we are lifting up.  It's an easy way to get rid of muscle soreness post a hard long run.

#### Super Soldier Pose (**Viparita Parivrtta Surya Yantrasana)**


If you have the time and the patience - do teach yourself this yoga asana because the hamstring stretch from this one is beautiful and you can feel the tension leaving your body. Also don't fret if you can't get the flexibility angle right - it always takes time, it must take time to get a good stretch!

#### Lunge with Knee down


Another yoga asana that is an easier variation of the twisting lunge. When done post run - it stretches the hip flexors and calms the beaten hamstrings down. Stay in it for at least 5 breaths till you move to the next yoga asana for your post run stretch.

#### **Eagle pose (Garudasana)**


As a runner my joints gets a solid beating running on the concrete. Unfortunately getting to the trails on daily basis in a luxury where I live. Eagle pose works as a great tension reliever for the joints. It loosens me up and I feel the blood flow through my ankles, knees, hips and elbows. Awesome post recovery! My back and neck don’t feel stiff and I feel

#### Headstand (Sirsasana)


I feel this is the most essential post-run yoga asana - and it does not matter whether you do it wall supported or not because immediately after a run what you  need is Leg Drain. You need to pull the blood down from your legs to the rest of the body. Hugely relaxing.  You can also find a wall and just lie on your back and invert your legs up on the wall. This inverted pose aids your overall recovery by draining fluids that are pooling in your legs, while also stretching your hamstrings and relieving a worn out lower body.

##### For all the above Yoga Asanas, always remember to:


- breathe to at least a count of 10!

- Repeat the pose on both sides.

- Push to the extent you feel the good stretch coming in. Don't take it to the level of physical pain.

- Not to worry much about flexibility and how perfect your pose is. Stick to getting a good post-run stretch.


**And finally -** Nothing like the Child Pose to end your post-run stretches. Don't pull, push or stretch any part of the body while in this one. Just enjoy the restful pose.

Happy Running !
