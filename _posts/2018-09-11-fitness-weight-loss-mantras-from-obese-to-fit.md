***Sanjeev and I wrote his story together. Though there are 1000s of such stories on Google, this one I have seen and been part of the [transformation.](https://wellthyfit.com/weight-loss-body-mind-life-transformation/) To me this story is about hard work, belief in the self and targeting goals.***


For the 1st 28 years of my life I was obese. I was the “fat kid”; actually clinically obese is the right word. I started gaining weight at 15. “All study and No Play” made me the fat kid. Not that I was brilliant in studies, but I enjoyed the food served to me at the study table. The result showed in my weight, than in my exam report.


At the peak of my weight issues, I weighed 88kgs at 5’4” frame with a waist size of 38”, you can do the math to calculate the BMI and most of the weight was fat not muscle mass.


I landed in Singapore on 4 th Dec 2001. I don't know the ratio of obese/fat people to healthy people in India, but with a population of 1 billion, there are plenty of people with the same weight issues. I wasn’t the odd one out. But Singapore with a population of 3 million and unbelievably fit people all around, turned out to be a blessing in disguise for me. I wanted to look good, sexy, wear fitted cloths, without feeling uncomfortable.


Within 1.5years [4 th Dec 2001 to Mid-2003], I dropped 24kgs, bringing body weight around 65kgs and waist size of 30”. For the last 13 years until today, I am trying to keep myself fit. I am not blessed in this case, I really need to work hard on my body to maintain it. My fitness mantra is to stay around 70Kgs and waist size 31–32 with a waist-hip ratio less than .90 and control my body fat percentage.


**There are millions of articles, guides available in Internet on how to reduce your body weight. But here is my take on it:**


1. **What you are is more important than what you think you are:** the weighing scale doesn’t lie, it is binary, it will show you how much is your exact weight, not how cute you look. If you are overweight, probably you are fat, accept it. Go to a gym, get an In-Body analysis, it is free in most of the gym, do a complete analysis and take it seriously, now not only accept it but work on it.

You now need to make a plan that suits your lifestyle and needs. Clear out the excuses. Start slow, progress gradually and then excel. The best way to start is to get an inspiration, not only motivation. Motivation will surely help you to start, but getting inspired by somebody and having the inspiration will keep you going.


3. **Get a trainer**: If you are not used to exercise, the best way for you to achieve your goals is to get a Personal Trainer. There are high chances of getting injured exercising the wrong way or you might spend hours and hours without nearing your goals. Personal word of advice — Gyms normally offer you a trainer who is free, rather than a trainer you need. If you are signing for some personal training sessions, talk to your trainer, share your fitness goal with him, take a session (normally it is free) and see for yourself. You can change your trainer if the approach isn’t working for you.


![](/assets/images/2016/05/bodh-crossfit.jpg)4. **Balance your exercise**: Understand your body, know your weak points and work on it. For me, its just not only weights, I try to balance it properly with Cardio and HIIT. No need to spend hours and hours in gym, unless you are really preparing for some body building competition. A short burst of 30 mins of HIIT is equally good. I work out 6 days a week. , 2 weights days and 2 Cardio and 1 HIIT and 1 day it I do a mix of all. I try to work on a max of 2 muscle groups during weights and in my mix day, I try to do low weight whole body.


5. **No Pain No Gain**: We often see it written in the gyms. But not all pain is good. The muscle burnout pain and the muscular pain is different. You should know what pain is this. If the pain is acute, STOP your work out, adjust your posture and if it still persists, go visit a doctor. The objective of a good exercise regimen is to be “pain free”.


“Pain is inevitable, but suffering is optional”. — Haruki Murakami,


6. **Repetitions -Repetitions- Repetitions**: This is 1 of the mantras to achieve your desired goals. Yes it is boring, yes it is monotonous, but it will give you the results you want. To avoid the monotony, do variations. You can work on the same muscle group with some variations. Before your workout, plan your reps and variations, add some music and just burn those extra calories you might have had in your dinner or lunch.


7. **Working out is not just Gyming:** For burning your extra calories, you just don't need a gym, you can burn it out anywhere. Running, Swimming, Cycling, any sports, find out your forte and burn. Take help of modern technology, APPS, Tracking Watches. You can enrol yourself and your colleagues, friends, family in “10000 steps a day challenge” [google out], you just need a pedometer, make you working out fun.


8. **When you work hard, you want to flaunt your earning:**  You will often see people in gym flexing their muscle looking themselves in mirror. Remember the person is not showing off but enjoying all the hard work he/she put on his/her body. Find happiness in whatever workout you are doing. Nobody told me that my abs are getting built at your dinner table, not at gym. . I am a foodie. But I have learnt to control my cravings. . Eating smaller portions and leaving the dining table feeling not completely full are somethings I practice on daily basis. I have practiced for past 13 years. Yes sometimes for a short period of time, I quit my workout regime, but in no time I went back.
