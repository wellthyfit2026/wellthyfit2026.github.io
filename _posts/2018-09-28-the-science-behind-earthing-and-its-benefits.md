As a health and yoga blogger, there is much out there for me to discover, unearth, practice, analyse and then write.


#### **And then, it was a fine morning, when moved by a whim....**


....I walked barefoot on a Goa beach on moist sand all along the contours of the sea waters for a continuous six kms. stretch and stumbled upon this indispensable yet beautiful health discovery .... the Earthing

With 4 more mornings under my feet, I decided to experiment. I habitually walked this length on the beach on prior three mornings in my sport shoes but this break of barefoot moist sand beach walk gave me a miraculously active day and oh me, a sleep struggler, had a wonderful seven hour effortless ( sound and deadly ) sleep the night on.

And here came the impetus to probe thoroughly on this health miracle of barefoot walking. As I delved on different Google sites on barefoot walking, I found to my utter perplexity that the world already seemed so aware of the health benefits of barefoot walk commonly known as  Earthing / Grounding / Bonding.

I knew that walking barefoot on morning dewy grass gives us relaxation and brings a fall of blood pressure to BP patients but was never told of the science behind it. Having gone through on Earthing fair enough, I now explain this science blended with some abstract passion.


### **Curious enough to know what is Earthing?**


Earthing  basically means staying in physical touch with the fundamental source of our origin i.e; the mother Earth. We can stay in touch with the Earth through barefoot walk or by sleeping on the floor or there are now gadgets to keep us linked with the Ground while we are indoors.

Earthing brings a benevolent free supply of pure, acceptable, absorbable and active antioxidants, the basic elements keeping our bodies ( and so also our mind) disease and deterioration free. Our own immune system also produces antioxidants and we also outsource these through supplements of Vit.C and E, Zinc, grapeseed extract and fresh foods like broccoli and the berries. But the biggest and the ever unfailing supplier is right under our feet i.e the Earth.


### **But quickly - What are Antioxidants?**


Antioxidants are free electrons available in vitamins/minerals and in various foods. These are used  by the body immune system or taken as food supplements to fix the otherwise damaging oxidants/free radicals, thereby preventing the body from fatigue, deterioration and the disease.


### How and why does our healthy body 'deteriorate'?


A healthy body produces oxidants, antioxidants, the carbon dioxide and the waste effluents by transfer of atoms (the basic grain of all physical things ) in proper desirable volumes. However, due to ecological imbalances, pollution, intake of intoxicating, chemical infested or GMO foods and life-style changes, our metabolism gets imbalanced and there is production of excess oxidants / free radicals which are the spectre molecules/atoms  that have lost their peace, have become radicals in conduct and are ever in free attacking mode on healthy molecules.

These are so because they have lost an electron ( antioxidant ) from their compostion and so the balance of electrical charge. In search therefore of their lost antioxidant, these bang other normal molecules and snatch their antioxidant, thus turning that into a spectre oxidant, who in turn attacks others setting off a vicious chain of attacks which is what we call as oxidation / deterioration of the body through weakening of immune system and muscles, alteration of DNA structures, of the sugar levels and that of blood pressure and causing many more diseases -  the ultimate being the cancer.

Not that these oxidants/free radicals/devil atoms work all vicious – the body immune system is smart enough to produce, deploy and dispatch these to areas of infections in the body to attack and set off a chain of oxidation / deterioration among the infecting bacterium molecules thus making these play a role of body defence and scavenging rather than usual role of offence.

### **Now the question arises as to how does Earthing / physical contact with earth surface contribute in prevention of fatigue / stress /disease and recovery and restoration of vitality and health ?**


The living bodies are majorly made up of water and mineral ions which combination is a good conductor of electrons/electrical charge.

So when we walk bare foot or our skin comes in contact with the earth by any other posture, free electrons /antioxidants start flowing automatically from high concentration at Earth’s surface to low concentration in our body.  These electrons are nature’s biggest antioxidants and help neutralise damaging excess free radicals that can lead to inflammation and disease in the body.

This transmission of charge is Earth’s energy – something akin to mothers milk for the child - that upgrades our physiology by allowing the body to cope and repair thereby promoting wellbeing, vitality and better sleep.  It also harmonizes and stabilizes the body’s basic biological rhythms, knocks down (and even knocks out) chronic inflammation and reduces and eliminates associated pain, making it the most natural and powerful anti-inflammatory and anti-aging remedy around!

***So folks – we are so badly addicted to the rubber soled shoes – the worst insulators of flow of Earth’s energy into our lives. Time now to resort to Earthing - a massively health friendly practice of return to contact with and benefit from our originator Earth by walking barefoot, sleeping on the floor and doing yoga / exercise barefoot. Even in the world of sports Earthing is being heavily resorted to these days for Athletic Recovery & Performance.***
