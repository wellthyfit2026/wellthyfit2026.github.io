Crunches are passe! Yoga Asanas for abs are totally in - if you want them for a lifetime, that is! Infact, I see my friends looking for something more meaningful for their abs! The right breathing with a slow workout has been proved extremely beneficial for the abs.

That's where [Yoga asanas](https://wellthyfit.com/10-best-yoga-asanas-for-a-healthy-heart/) step in! So here - [Seema Yadav](http://www.zevenworld.com/running/news/seemas-inner-strength-comes-to-fore) (the flying runner and an avid Yoga practitioner) and I have put together 5 solid abs yoga asanas that everyone regardless of a need for abs must do! By doing these you'll engage your core muscles and concentrate on balance and breathing.

Stay as long as you can, breathe in and breathe out, and aim to hold each yoga asana for 10 breaths!Remember to do these poses deliberately slow as that is how you engage your core and build strength!

Stay Wellthyfit! Workout with a friend! Have Fun!

Do it along - Seema and Tanya
