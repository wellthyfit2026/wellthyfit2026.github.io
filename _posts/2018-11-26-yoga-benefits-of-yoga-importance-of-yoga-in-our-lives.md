*“**Yoga means addition – an addition of energy, strength, and beauty to body, mind, and soul.”***
*–Amit Ray, Meditation: Insights and Inspiration*

Yoga is a perfect combination of physical, mental and spiritual well-being. Since it is practiced from ancient times, one can easily notice the effects on the body of those who practice yoga regularly. There are different styles of yoga like Vinyasa, Ashtanga, Hatha, Iyengar, Kundalini yoga etc. All these styles have their own significance and are performed for the betterment of the body and mind. It was suggested by the Prime Minister of India to the United Nation in 2014, that June 21 should be celebrated as International Yoga Day, as it is the longest day of the year.  We published an [interesting article](https://wellthyfit.com/yoga-international-day-5-amazing-yoga-stories-world/)  on International Yoga Day last year bringing some amazing stories about Yoga.

There are numerous benefits of yoga in our daily life, but in this article, we are going to look at the basic changes yoga can bring in your life:

By doing simple exercises like kapalbharti, anulom vilom and surya namaskar can help in cutting off a few inches, and with regularity, you can say goodbye to extra pounds forever. Also, with regular practice of yoga, we become sensitive to our body needs and functions and keep the process of food intake in check.
