Yoga is the one of the most natural and trusted ways to keep your heart in good health. Why? Because it stretches your body in both easy and vigorous poses with immense focus on breathing. And it is this emphasis on breathing which is works on the respiratory system and finally keeps the heart rate in check, stimulates blood circulation and increases lung capacity. Yoga has an amazing science compiled into many different kinds of breathing techniques that can keep one disease free through a lifetime. Something that needs to be practiced to understand.

As a 9 year Yoga practitioner myself, I cannot think of any yoga pose that does not improve the health of our heart. But here is a hearty compilation of easy yoga asanas that can be practiced by anyone, any age and any shape to work on the health of their heart.


1. ### **Sukhasana (Easy Pose)**


Sukhasana is one of the basic yoga asana and suitable for yogis of all levels. This name is derived from the Sanskrit where sukha meaning "comfort", and asana meaning "Pose". This simple sitting posture can be done at the beginning & end of yoga practice as a mini meditation. Sit in a cross-legged position, with your right shin in front of your left. If your hips are tight, sit on a folded blanket or bolster to make it easier to keep your back straight and relax down your shoulder. Rest your hands' palms facing up, on your knees, close your eyes, and inhale & exhale breathe with the count. When your mind wanders so it will just focus on your breath.

### **2.****Tadasana (Palm Tree Pose)**


Tadasana is simply known for stretching, which forms the basis for all standing as standing asanas. It performed at the beginning and end of the Surya Namaskar (read my article on Surya Namaskar [here](https://wellthyfit.com/the-secret-8/)) sequence and is a key asana for all yoga practices. It's a good asana for cultivating strength, sense of relaxed power and it also can be helpful for both physically and mentally grounding, and can be used to form a connection with the earth. The longer you learn to stay in it with proper breathing, the more it calms your mind and benefits your heart. And this asana can be practiced by anyone.

### **4. Bhujangasana (Cobra Pose)**


It is a helpful yoga asana for backend practiced from a face-down position that warms and strengthens the spine while opening the chest. This opening of  chest helps to clear the passages of the heart and lungs - Which further invigorates the heart.  A healthy heart comes from an improved circulation of blood and oxygen - more so from throughout the spinal and pelvic regions.
