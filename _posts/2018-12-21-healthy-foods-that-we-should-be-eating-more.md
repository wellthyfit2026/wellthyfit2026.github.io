The healthy foods vs the unhealthy ones - The battle is rather confusing for the layman. The world is taking pride in going fat-free, I am trying hard to explain that fat-free does not mean calorie-free!


Infact fat-free is even worse - the food industry synthetically removes the goodness of the food just to sell more! Calories, sodium and fiber are completely sidelined today by just reading fat-free! And that’s where begins the war of whether some seemingly unhealthy foods are really unhealthy??? Is this really about [weight loss](https://wellthyfit.com/weight-loss-5-factors-critical-to-success-of-your-weight-loss-plan/) or weight gain?


To break some initial myths, Wellthy.Fit picked up these 7 healthy foods that the world is sidelining every day in the name of full of fat, too much cholestrol or unhealthy!!!

**Have you been discarding any of the above foods as unhealthy? Leave the name of one daily food that you consider unhealthy!**
