## **1. Make Fruits & Vegetables Your Best Friends-**

Eat fruits and veggies for good health!!Fruits and
vegetables are a storehouse of fiber which can not only fill you up but would
also provide you with a great dose of antioxidants and nutrients like Vitamin
C, Vitamin A, Vitamin K, copper, iron, magnesium, potassium and folic acid.


Stock up on fruits rich in Vitamin C such as
orange, sweet lime, grapefruit, guava which can also help in keeping cold and
flu at bay.


So if you are planning to go for a party then
consume a bowl of salad or stir fry before heading for the party or if at a
wedding try and fill half your plate with salads minus the fatty dressings this
will not only fill you up but would not allow you to over eat. Consume at least
2 servings of fruits everyday and munch on a fruit whenever you feel the need
to snack. You can also add fruits to a bowl of oatmeal/sugar free muesli or add
it to a bowl of yogurt.


## **2. Drink Plenty of Water & Herbal Teas-**

Drink enough water and have herbal teas! Water is very
necessary if you have to detoxify your body and maintain a healthy weight. It
helps you in staying full for longer duration and avoid over eating during any
of the meals.


Drink at least 12-15 glasses of water per day and if you are bored of the idea of having normal water then throw in some cucumber slices, lemon wedges, mint leaves and ginger. Not only would it impart a great taste to the existing bottle of water but will also help you [lose weight](https://wellthyfit.com/weight-loss-body-mind-life-transformation/).


Add on a few herbal teas like chamomile,
peppermint and lemongrass tea to the daily diet and reap numerous benefits.
Herbal teas are minus caffeine and have a calming and soothing effect which
would not only enable good sleep but will also aid in better digestion.


## **3. Stay Away From Refined & Packaged Foods-**

Stay away from refined and packaged foods! While refined
foods might look really tasty and tempting they are actually responsible in
taking you away from your weight loss goals. Refined foods such as cookies,
cakes, pastries, pasta, burgers, breads, doughnuts and pizza are loaded with
refined flour our very own ''maida'' which can lead to spike in insulin levels
and speed up the process of fat storage in the body.


On the other hand packaged foods such as
maggi, soups, gravies, sausages are loaded with preservatives and excessive
amounts of sodium whose excessive consumption can predispose you to various
health issues.


Rather than consuming these foods which can
be detrimental to your health go ahead and consume foods loaded with fiber such
as brown rice, oats, quinoa, barley, buckwheat or broken wheat. These foods
would not only help you in staying full for longer duration but would also
maintain the blood sugar levels to optimum. So ultimately the weight would stay
in check and the winter season would pass easily without any weight blues.


## **4. Do Not Forget To Eat A Protein Rich Meal-**


![Eat a protien rich diet for a healthy you and not gain weight](/assets/images/2019/01/Picture-4-Proteins.jpg)


Eat a protein rich meal for a healthy you! Always aim at
consuming a meal which is high on fiber, has moderate proteins and is low on fat.
Proteins can help in curbing sugar cravings and aid in maintaining one’s
weight. It can also balance the blood sugar levels really well. It has also
been seen that foods with high protein levels have a low GI and hence can help
you in losing weight.


Consume foods such as paneer, Greek yogurt,
soy, lentils, beans, chicken, fish, eggs, sunflower seeds, chia seeds, almonds,
milk, soymilk and walnuts to get a daily dose of protein. Protein is enough to
give you a feeling of fullness and protect you from going overboard where food
is concerned.


## **5. Consume A Soup Bowl Before Lunch & Dinner-**


![Bowl of soup before dinner leads to better weight management](/assets/images/2019/01/Picture-5-Soups.jpg)


A bowl of soup during the winter season! Make it a habit
to consume a bowl of veggie soup prior to your lunch or dinner. This practice
would not only fill you up but will also make sure that you eat minimal food
during lunch and dinner. This can also help you in managing your weight and
increase your veggie consumption during the day. But make sure that you do not
add too much butter or heavy cream to the soup.


Prepare a fresh soup using carrots, tomato,
cabbage, beetroot and add in some crushed ginger, garlic, black pepper and
mixed herbs. This soup is excellent for weight loss and at the same time would
protect you from cold and flu. You can also make a soup of your choice by
adding kidney beans, sprouted moong, paneer or dal to the existing vegetable
broth. Enjoy it warm! It shall soothe your throat and help you in managing the
cold weather really well.
