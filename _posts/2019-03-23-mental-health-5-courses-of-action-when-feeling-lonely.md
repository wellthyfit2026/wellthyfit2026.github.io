***This is not  a mere article on my blog. This is something above them all. An insight of her approach towards life. This self-cultivated attitude let her see the brighter side of life.***


*And this bird never looked back since then. She flew and flew. More like a mighty river creating a  huge reservoir of water after getting harnessed by canals and dams. Guys! Welcome to  another content- piece of “motivation” series.*

***First of all! Feeling lonely does not mean you are in anxiety or in any kind of depression!** It's just another feeling similar to happiness, joy, gratitude etc. And it is completely okay to feel it.*


*We have the right to experience all the emotions of life and that is why, we are called humans. Correct me if I am wrong! But every feeling has a lasting time and leaves behind an impact that plays a significant role. Some leave behind a  ‘dancing you’  and some an ‘angry you’.*


*I approached her one day and asked what should I do to master those impacts? How can..*


*She interrupted me and said,” Will you stop eating food if you want to lose weight?”*


*I replied in negative.  “Similarly, you cannot  stop your mind  getting enticed to pessimism but you can definitely minimise it.” She then explained me her own modus operandi.*


***Let's have a look at these five Mantras that would make us fall in love with ourselves and I promise you would become pioneer in overcoming this feeling of loneliness in no time***


- ***REALISING THAT EVERYTHING COMES WITH AN EXPIRY DATE***


*This embarks a feeling of settlement! Nothing is constant! And we somehow start accepting that sorrow shall not last forever. (which is more important than accepting the abridgement of happiness)*

- ***PLAN YOUR WEEK! AND WATCH HOW CLOSER YOU
HAVE COME TOWARDS YOUR GOAL***


*Attainment! Yes! I feel I have attained something when I go through my yesterday’s chores and I don’t need any certificate of achievement from anyone else for that. My 'achieved' list and a strike on the to-do is a motivator by itself.*

- ***KISS THE NATURE WITH A SOLO TRIP***


*There is nothing more desirable than this. Trust me! Pack your bag and take a break from your responsibilities for two days! I am soon coming with an article on the most exciting places for solo trips. Yes! It requires guts and this is the thing which I want you to feel for yourself. Read my blog on my solo trip [here.](https://wellthyfit.com/woman-go-travel-alone-go-take-the-plunge/)*

- ***HAVE GRATITUDE  AND WRITE POSITIVE AFFIRMATIONS DAILY***


*Ever heard of Rhonda Byrne? Read her life-changing words in her book - [The Secret.](https://www.thesecret.tv/products/the-secret-book/) It's all about feeling good and changing your life.*


*Loneliness is a deep feeling. It hurts you, frustrates you. THIS IS THE TIME - to fold your hands, look up in the sky, close your eyes and go through the best moments of your life, to thank the powers for all that you have. You might have goosebumps and a happy tears as you realize how blessed you are. Facing our deepest feelings change us.*


- ***PERSUE A HOBBY! REALISE!  YOUR HOBBY IS YOUR MEDITATION!***


![PERSUE A HOBBY! REALISE!  YOUR HOBBY IS YOUR MEDITATION! Wellthyfit.com](/assets/images/2019/03/hobby-running.jpg)


*You read it right! If your mind, body and soul get directed towards the hobby you are pursuing; when you are unable to hear anything while dancing; if you forget food while painting; you are actually practicing meditation. And I need not summarise, here, the benefits of this priceless practice. People around the world have embraced their lonliness beautifully by submerging themeselves in a passion they feel alive in.*


- ***GET ENGAGED WITH A BEAUTIFUL BOOK! IF NOT
BOOK, THEN A DOCUMENTARY***


*Couple of  books changed my life! First, directed a big foodie towards the path of holistic eating and second, took her out of virtual world. Second - An autobiography of Andre Agassi that made me realise -we are all human, we make mistakes and me must stay motivated - because nothing good comes easy.*

- ***PAMPER YOURSELF WITH A SALOON SERVICE AND FEEL CONFIDENT***


*Man or a woman - go ahead, get that pampering therapy. Figure what makes you feel beautiful, fresh - all over again. A head massage, a pounding body massage, a pedicure, a hair spa - hey! Don't feel judged - just feel beautiful all over again.*


- ***CALL YOUR BOON COMPANIONS BECAUSE IT’S BEST
TIME TO PARTY***


![call your boon companions. It's the best time to party. wellthyfit.com](/assets/images/2019/03/dab-it.jpg)


***Though you don’t need anyone to cheer you up, still spread happiness and you will get back in abundance!***


***This life is ours!***


***We are its architect!***


***The key of this lock is with us only!***


***Sometimes we misplace the key.***


***We just need to find it again it and she did it.***


**T*****aking farewell from you, will meet you in my next write-up!**!*
