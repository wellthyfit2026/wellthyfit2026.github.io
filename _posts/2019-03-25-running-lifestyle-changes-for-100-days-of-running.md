We need to do something extra-ordinary if we want to achieve extra-ordinary. 100 Days of Running is round the corner and it is high time that we start taking baby steps towards change in our lifestyle.


It requires planning. It requires efforts. Even small tweaks will put you on the path of healthier habits.  But it all starts from a decision. Time, Diet, mental peace, family life need to be in sync if we want to prepare for HDOR and make it a life changing event. Let us go through them.


## ***Time Management***


100 Days of running is an effective platform where we can learn how to use time productively, especially when we work. Each and every individual on this planet has got 24 hours. It is true that we cannot increase our time but efficiency enhancement can definitely cover up for same.


This sports event will require a considerable amount of practice and rehearse so that we can bear muscle howling protest during these 100 days. But what flickers in our mind is when to practice so that it doesn’t hamper other chores. How to work smart? How to get more done in less time when pressure is high? You cannot run 10 kms, the very first day, if you are a newbie and couch. Accept and acknowledge that it would take time to climb the ladder. Start by building your mileage on a weekly basis. Run 3 -5 days during initial weeks and then go for this challenge.


- Studies show that it is best to run at the time
when your body temperature is highest which is perhaps the reason people find
it more convenient to run in the evening.
- It requires around 24 weeks of training and practice
to run for half marathon. For immediate and advanced runners, it requires
around 10 weeks.


## WHEN TO RUN FOR 100 DAYS OF RUNNING


During the challenge, you need to set a particular time
which can be continued for 100 days. It would be best if it is not interrupted.


- **Spring up one hour early in the morning**! Use less of social media applications during night which takes a toll on your sleep.
- **If you are an evening runner, stop gossiping after work hours** and utilise that time for the challenge. Just for 100 days! And trust us! You would be having more gossips after this challenge, that too productive ones.
- **It is completely okay to run at night.** In fact, it will make you fall asleep faster and you would get greater health and performance benefits.
- **Utilise your lunch timings**if you are unable to run during your regular timings. Just carry your sports shoes and apparel. No one is going to point you. If yes, they would be the first people  to come and ask you about the challenge on 101st day.
- If you feel little bit bored during this challenge or require some ingenuity, we have a solution for you. **Pamper yourself by the end of every week for completing 7 days** of continuous runs. Ask your father, beau, sibling to take you to shopping, your favourite pizza place, for a movie, therapeutic massage etc. as a reward. It definitely helps.


## ***Diet Management***


We completely agree eating is one of the sublime pleasures
of life. But as said, “A Balanced Diet is a cookie in each hand”. You would
have to shun legendary junk food binges because a good diet will make you
perform better. And if it is improving your health, this sacrifice is worth it.
Nutrition during is to be taken care of to the max. There is a beautiful
article by Tanya Agarwal on Running Nutrition. It will definitely help so that
you can have a watch over your eating patterns during the challenge. Click [here](https://wellthyfit.com/nutrition-plant-based-food-everyday-running-health/)
for same.


## ***Family life***


Now you have to set priorities. You need to make sure that
this challenge doesn’t hamper your career and family. You should not feel any
guilt by the end of challenge because it will move the clock in reverse order.
Balancing work and family life seems nearly impossible at times. “How would I
be able to add one more chore in my routine?” We are damn sure this question
might me striking in your mind! We have a fantastic remedy for you!


- Involve your family in this challenge. The minimum
run limit is 2 kilometres and age limit is 12 years.
- If impossible, involve them indirectly. Ask your
wife/ children if they can help you in watching your diet or waking you up
early in the morning. They will find themselves involved and would be more
excited than you. An added advantage!
- Plan a family trip after this 100 days running
challenge.
- Make one day your special day in a week. Take
them to their favourite place.


## ***Mental Satifaction***


- Practice mindfulness. Pen down how you felt
while running right from Day 1 to Day 100. And observe change in your thoughts.
- Meditate at least for 15 minutes. It will keep
you more focussed towards your goal. And in maintaining the synchronisation
between different spheres of life.
- Share
the joy!
