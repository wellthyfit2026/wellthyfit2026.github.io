I was registering for the Dwarka half Marathon in September since there was a crazy deal of 70% off on it. But there was something crazier out there which got my attention and I thought of bringing it out to the larger community:

The organisers at Dwarka Half Marathon are charging women runners half the price of what the male runners are paying. No - this is not a discount. This is the actual price. (on top of that there is another 70% off,  but that's a discount and different and not what I want to discuss).  The men pay 1600, while the women pay – Rs. 800. See it [here for](https://www.townscript.com/e/dwarka-half-marathon-charity-run-034242/booking) yourselves.


My feminist mind was racing hard here, but before my mind
went on a rant – I asked myself a few questions?


- Could this be to bring out more and more women to run?
- Does a lesser price encourage men to bring out the women?
- Does it help women convince their families back home if they have to pay lesser for a run?
- Are women runners treated ‘special’ because women are still given ‘special’ treatment?


I quickly checked for registration rates for women all around the world – From World Majors to small country, city and local runs – the fees has always been the same for both the genders.


## Now the bigger question:


Will such a strategy bring out more and more women to run? Is it for better or for worse? Will this influence other event organizers? Marketing Gimmick or Need of the Day????


I, for sure, sent the info to my female runners and who doesn’t love a great running experience at half the price!????
