***Hello, I am Manju Viswanathan and I am 39 years old. Every year on my birthday, I ask myself “Why are you celebrating this day? What have you achieved so far?”***


The answer typically would be -“Well, I have learned so much, earned this much, blah blah..” but I have never found a convincing answer to myself. But then I hoped to have something bigger and better for my next birthday. I would hopefully say “Yes..I have achieved something (which may not seems great to many)”, I would proudly say *I ran for 100 Days and successfully completed the task.*


**I am a very normal woman with all the health issues and difficulties that each and every typical human being would face in their life.**  During my childhood days, I was never seen in the playground nor was I into sports.

But then, I started walking an year ago, and I liked it because I got some fresh air and could listen to my favourite songs , both of which added to keeping me in high spirits through the day. It also allowed me to explore new routes in my area.


**When I joined U2 Group on Facebook, I was so inspired to see the running updates posted everyday.** It got me wondering “how do they run so much?” And so when Mr.Shan, my friend and founder of U2 asked me “Why can’t you take this challenge?” I jumped and said YES. Surprisingly, I did not have any seconds thoughts nor did I wonder if I could actually do it.


I have committed to myself, *You are running..that’s all*. It did not matter how far I could go, I would still do what I could.


## **I have never ever run and so it was very new to me.**


On the very first day, I ran 5kms. I had no clues about the Pace, Speed, Marathon training/running etc etc..**On the 4th day,** luckily I found a group running in my area, soon I joined them and learnt a lot about right form of running, stretches and how to run .. and here is what I accomplished thereon.   
To my surprise,   
**On Day 51**, I ran my first 10 Km @ Marudhamalai Road   
**On Day 58**, I ran my first 10 Km Marathon (Jun 24th) sponsored by Asian Paints.   
**On Day 72**, my second 10 Km Marathon (Jul 8th) @ Kovai pudur.  
**On Day 89**, Completed my personal goal of 400 Km running.


## **While it is all easy as I sit and recall the journey now, it was quite hard**.


![The 100 days of running without a break was a tough one. Manju Viswathan. wellthyfit.com](/assets/images/2019/04/manju-half.jpg)


The 100 days without a break was a tough one.  Not to forget the questions I was asked by people around – why are you running at this age, why are you running on road, are you not ashamed of people watching you running, why are you wearing t-shirts, why did you cut your hair so short.. As it is I was dealing with my own struggles- unexpected travels, guests at home, monthly periods, work pressures, knee injury, etc, all of which made daily running quite a task…


**One other thing that was running in the mind of those around was that “she might not stick to this for 100days”**.


It could be because I had many interests- writing, painting, crafting, singing and so on,  but I lost interest within a few weeks and moved to the next thing that got my attention.  But then, with this 100day running challenge I wanted to prove to myself that I could stick to it and do it!


**I am glad and proud I did..**


I owe my achievement to the *U2 Team & Coimbatore Runners - Saibaba Colony Team* for all their guidance, support and continuous encouragement & support. (Not mentioning anyone in particular as the list might run to many pages).   
I also Thank my beloved husband Mr.Balasubramanian who has been so supportive to complete my task and my family for all the unconditional support extended.


## So, What did I get by running 100 days?


1) Drastic inch loss with 0 weight loss  
2) Boost to my confidence levels  
3) I could run upto 10 Km comfortably which was only 100 steps on Day 1.  
4) Completed 2 Marathons so far and many more to come.  
5) ‘Early to bed and early to rise’ has become a habit again.  
6) Health conditions are much better now.  
7) Made a good bunch of new friends.
