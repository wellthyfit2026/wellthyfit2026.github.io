**Beyond the everyday to-do lists, early to bed and early to rise - let there be some chance, happenstance and randomness. This is not a quote. This is me  having gone by May and June of 2019. But first go back home and break that piggy bank, please!**

Okay well here's some randomness that happened to me:


#### **A train ride with my daughter**


![](/assets/images/2019/07/Saisha-in-train-2.jpg)![](/assets/images/2019/07/train-with-sai.jpeg)

 

I am the kid of the 80s who has traveled most of India by trains. Train journey are generous - leg space, baggage space and you are forced to slow down. I still dig train journeys and I figured it's also the best way to get stuck in a place to spend time with my daughter.  She sat by the window seat and looked out for a while. Then returned to her book, then a random conversation with me. On repeat. We made sure to carry our readings. Which parent doesn't like her child enjoy books?"Being stuck" in a train is so good for the brain. And overall I saw an engaged kid. But the loos are so dirty - it spooked me out too ! Just for fun, we hopped from one compartment to other. Got off at Ambala station for a bit (there's a thrill in getting on and off a train). I want to do this more often with my kids. Do you?


#### **Picked these three books by Ruskin Bond**


Books full of quotations are such a cliché – but not these. These are gold. I would gift these to people only close to my heart. Ruskin Bond has a way of putting warmth even while collecting quotes in his books. Brilliant and beautiful. I suggest you use them to gift, add to your collection, but don’t forget to give them a read. The Little Book Of Courage has unique words from Unknown writers. Their is power in words.

#### **Recorded my First Podcast**


Why random ???? Because I don't do this everyday.  It was all about Wellthyfit. Yay !! I invest my time, my pride and my heart into my blog. My excitement is contagious even to myself when am talking about my page. It's a one woman webpage. It's my armour. My soft pillow. My thinking pole. My refuge. The podcast will be out soon and you, my dear reader, you shall be deluged with my voice!

![](/assets/images/2019/07/podcast-pic.jpeg)Lets talk a bit about podcasts. I have been listening to podcasts on more regular basis for over 3 months now. Allow me to take you through the ones I really like. Godin Seth's podcast is called [akimbo.me.](https://www.akimbo.me/)If you are keen to learn about modern management, leadership ideas, marketing your ideas - then there is great stuff on this podcast.

The second podcast I have been devoring is [Dooce](https://dooce.com/podcast/). It's Heather Armstrong's baby and she is brilliantly capturing life in her podcasts. Books, Sleep, Music, Kids, Travel - she has it all, you just need to lend her your ears.

As a runner, I enjoy listening to a few podcasts - the one that stands out at the moment is [Kelly Robert's podcast](https://shecanandshedid.com/run-selfie-repeat-podcast).

 


#### **Took a hike with my kids**


Random because I would love to do so more much of it than a one off activity. We headed to Barot in Himachal Pradesh. Parked ourselves in [Trekker's Nest](http://www.trekkersnest.com/) (fantastic place that I will review soon) by the river Uhl...and then took 720 stairs and walked to a waterfall. My father and my kids were so thrilled to do the trek cum hike. I questioned myself - what stops me doing this more often with my kids ? What excuse do I have ? More for sure - I tell myself with a deep determined breath. Leap - maybe the net will appear. Would you? [Here's a link to a trek](https://wellthyfit.com/fitness-life-daughter-mom-mountain-hiking-mothers-day/) I had taken with my daughter back in 2015.

#### **108 Surya namaskars on the sukhna lake in Chandigarh**


I am a yoga practitioner and it's expected that I do them often. I do. But not 108. Infact I did 108 exactly after a year. Last I did these was in 2018 - yoga day. I am reminded what a great detoxifier it is. The intensity is rejuvenating too. I don't know when I will next focus on this number again in my practice.

 


#### **Smashed my kids' piggybank**


You know this is such a big deal. Because you can never put it back? Even though I knew there were less than 200 bucks in it. It was quite a decision that the three of us had to take! My son couldn’t believe that I had actually allowed them to smash their piggybank ! He felt tickled at the idea of it. My daughter spent hours guessing how much money it would have and what was she going to do with it. We debated on that issue but most of all we stayed super chuffed with the idea of smashing a piggybank! I couldn't take pictures of the smashed piggybank. I don't even remember why but I guess it was such a fun evening between my kids and me.
