Dear Runner Moms,

Are you new to running? Been running for a while? Taken a break from running? Going back to Running? I started running with an infant and a toddler in the house. Running and Mothering have played an inexplicable role in my life ( I literally rolled and ran through those "diaper, sleepless nights, I only want mommy" days). I don't know how old your kids are at the moment - some of the following may or may not work for you - but I stay positive - at least one will!

1. **Thou shall teach/ counsel/ coach your kids to be Runner mom KIDS** – Yes (as much as you can at whatever age they are)! Tell them that you wake up earlier to go running. Share your targets with them. Let them know – Running puts a smile on their mom’s face and it must stay. ( My younger one was 1 year old, when we asked him – where was mumma – he said – gone NUNNING!!! :)

2. **Thou shall learn to Juggle on DAILY BASIS.** Learn to do this. You will only get better by making mistakes as you juggle. You want to run – you better learn to move the pieces and get the puzzle right ( for most days). (It's ok if you forget your name in the process )

3. **Thou shall Ask for help**. Without overthinking. The supermom/ superwoman concept will leave you weak internally and externally without being effective and efficient.

4. **Thou shall not BEAT yourself over for sometimes wanting to be more of a RUNNER and sometimes more of a MOTHER.** The balance is elusive, almost always! ( 5 years and struggling - But we won't have it any other way, would we?)

5. **Thou shall [EAT better](https://wellthyfit.com/running-runners-to-eat-or-not-to-eat/)** and better to stay stronger and stronger to deal with load of love that comes both for running and mothering. Compromises are a big No No here! So is laziness! ( Yes Ok - Maggi is fine somedays - just add some veggies to it)

6. **Thou shall allow yourself the luxury of NAPPING** – when you can afford to! Lives are not regimented – so drop for a bit when you can. (my help does )

7. **Thou shall celebrate your milestones and victories with or without your kids.** Don’t pretend like you don’t care or it’s not enough. You worked hard for it and you did it, you better treat yourself and make it a damn memory.

8. **Thou shall constantly work on your mindset** – and when you can’t, just go and take a nap. Or binge watch some web series or try and get some cuddles. Discouragements happen both in running and mothering – and more often than we think and share.

9. **Thou shall kick that person (and yourself) in the face who blames your 'Running' for your bad "Mother" days and vice versa.** Some days mothering will tire you out, some days running will - mostly both will simultaneously. On either occasions - deep breaths please! (Runners are naturally good at kicking and breathing - so go on!)

10. **Thou shall not give up on your long term Run dreams** . For bad days your Mantra will be– This too shall pass. But You will not give up on your run dreams. Delay them, go slow, but keep coming back to them. Your kids will one day admire you for the person you ‘became’ while raising them and chasing your dreams. Both ways – HARD ENOUGH!

Running is the greatest metaphor for life. So is parenting. Living two great metaphors is exciting and challenging. I am a better mother because I am a runner? I am a better runner because I am a mother??? Here's to never stopping to figuring this one out.

yours truly,

Your Fellow Runner Mom!
