Who remembers that book by Dr. Suess - Oh, The places You'll Go". I have revisited this book because of my kids, have read to them with so much emotion, not knowing that the shoes in my feet will steer me to beautiful places and that too for Running.  And India is just beautiful. There isn't a side of it that won't leave you amazed. It's everything, it has everything.


My shoes, my love for [travelling and running](https://wellthyfit.com/running-through-cities-countries-seasons-roads/), and then [goheritageruns.com](https://www.goheritagerun.com/) steered me towards Orchha, a quaint sleepy little town by the banks of River Betwa, to run a half marathon. About 20 kms from Jhansi in Madhya Pradesh. While Orchha is a well known historical jewel, Jhansi - the city famous for Rani Laxmi Bai, turned out to be a pleasant surprise.


Firstly I loved how easy the travel to Jhansi was. A train that goes straight from Delhi to Jhansi!  It was super convenient and relaxing with two kids in tow.

Jhansi is a transit hub to Orchha, Khajuraho and Gwalior. But just coming back to Jhansi - it's green, lots of history in and around. The highlight of my visit to Jhansi was exploring the Jhansi Fort with my kids. The stories of Rani lakshmibai's warrior bravery truly comes to life as you walk around the fort. I wish a big world director picks up the story of this brave warrior and makes an unforgettable animation movie! I wish!


To my surprise Jhansi was certainly more fun than I expected! I actually see myself coming back here again - maybe biking! Maybe some more running, the city is fantastically green on the outskirts, with large expanses of green lands merging and beautiful ruins all over. What more do I want? Well - I want more places for running!!!!


For now for all the fitness freaks reading this blog, want to visit Jhansi and participate in an event too, [here is the link](http://tristar.coachravinder.com/tristar-triathlon.html) to a triathlon that is about to take place soon.

Orchha - 20 kms from Jhansi is a quiet little haven called Orchha! Orchha, a small ...very small town by the banks of the River Betwa. My hotel was right behind the magnificent cenotaphs of Bundela kings and noblemen, set in a site almost overlooking the mighty Betwa River. Built in the 17th and 18th Century, the fifteen tombs or rather cenotaphs or chattris as they call them, were built more as memorials.


**If you plan to come here with friends, family or even solo - You won't regret.**


- Affordable hotels within the range of (3-5k), it's a really small with an old bazaar.

- You can walk all over the place and not feel unsafe for a moment. I certainly, didn't.

- But no cafes etc. - When I say it's a small place, it is truly small and eateries are limited to the hotels.

- I loved the old bazaar road and market. Nooks of street food, "dogs and cows banging into you" :) kinda feel all the time.

There is a lot of history around the lives and times of the Bundela Kings, the legacy of men who gave life to this place and if you actually end up going to the light and sound show at the Orchha Fort at night ( it's so brilliantly spooky my kids just loved it as much as I did) you will hear it all. I don't want to sound like a historian who dug up all websites on the history of Orchha ( even though I did) and write everything here.


## **AND I RAN A HALF MARATHON THROUGH IT ALL !**

What is Orchha's unique selling point? The history? It's peace? Actually - It's the River Betwa that flows by this quaint little place that adds immense charm to its beauty. My family decided to hit the river early morning and find peaceful spots to sit and play with water. And well, So did I !

*"Even though there'll be hang -ups, and bang-ups, lonely, scary roads, your arms may get sore, your sneakers may leak, Step with care and great tact, remember that's life, just don't mix your left foot with right! coz life is a great balancing act :) " - Dr. Suess*
