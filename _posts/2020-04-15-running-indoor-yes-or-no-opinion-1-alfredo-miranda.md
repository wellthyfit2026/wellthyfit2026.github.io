*As Covid-19 pandemic grips the world deeper and wider, India who had already put the nation on a 21 day lockdown, yesterday further extended the nation wide 'curfew' to May 3rd, 2020. Most Runners have already started running indoors - living rooms, lobbies, home to lift lobby - covering distances of 21kms and more on 30-40 metres loops inside the house! Though most others still stand on the fence! If social distancing has to be practiced, then staying put is the only answer. Do read the 10 commandments of a locked down runner. If you cannot live without running ( like me), then let's hear out some wise men and women talk about their ideas, concerns and wisdom over Indoor running.*


**Alfredo Miranda**


Should we be running indoors given the pandemic situation? This a tricky question. All depends on the reasons, the “should” normally comes as respond to a “what” or a “want”. “I want ‘X’, so… to achieve it… should I run indoors?”


If ‘X’ is: “to stay active”, “to do some aerobic exercise”, “to move legs and body in similar way as road-running and engage my metabolism”, “to remind people at home that I am not quitting running”, “to take part in some challenge in my running group”, etc… Then, indoors running is a good option.


If ‘X’ is: “to get a PB the day-1 after the lockdown”, “to not lose speed in my 100m time”, etc.. Then, things can get problematic.


Inside the house: the surface is harder than the roads. The shorter stretches make you run more on your toes. There are more frequent and sharper turns than running outside. This means that the running technique will change, if it is done with high intensity it may lead to injuries or unexpected pains.


However, if it done with moderation, without wanting to break any world record, just easy jogging around the furniture at home or the pipes at the terrace of the building: it is a perfect option for these days !!!! In any case, do it gradually, increasing the time day after day: 10 mins, 20 mins....and the moment you feel any pain, stop or reduce the time.


These days will affect your performance. You can’t expect to get back at the same point, but it won’t be a disaster either: it will take you few weeks to get back to where you were before, but you will be there, for sure!! So, just relax, don’t get overstresed about your performance: enjoy your house-running and do a lot of strengthening workouts.


I would further like to share my experience with "lockdowns":

In October 2018, I had an accident while running which spoilt both my  feet. For 20 days I was “locked down” to bed… to ensure better healing. Then, for another 2 months I was “locked down” to cast and crutches. During all that time:


NO STRENGTHENING  
NO SKIPPING  
NO HIIT


What was the impact in my running ????  
NOTHING AT ALL !!!!! I got back where I was before.


Now, you are in a much better position.  
So, Don’t panic: do some indoor workouts and relax both, mentally and emotionally:  
YOU WILL BE FINE !!!!!!!!


## For Now.....
