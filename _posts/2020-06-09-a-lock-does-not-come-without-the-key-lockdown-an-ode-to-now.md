*Life can be a veritable mess of stress and last-minute scrambling. Many  like myself are anxious about upcoming events and what exactly they can accomplish this summer due to limited opportunities. I get it, I really do. As someone who has been working for over 20 years and is used to multi tasking and is hyper active being under the lockdown was not easy, I empathize with everyone out there who is struggling to stay positive. But that very feeling of hopelessness is why I wanted to write this short article. I would like to share with you all my simple strategy for keeping myself moving at all times.*


*For the longest time, I remember frantically worrying about the money I bring home ,times are tough hope I will have a job tomorrow, the impression I left on my interviewers, and how others would perceive my actions. I was caught in a never-ending cycle of overthinking my situation and worrying about the result. However, I came to realize something: sometimes the effort we put in is just one point on a list of factors that determine the outcome. The success of an interview can depend on your interviewer’s mood just as much as it can depend on your preparation.*


*So, I decided that I would, literally, leave it at that. No more stressing about the result, no more worrying about how others would view me, and no more slowing down.*


*Do your honest best and leave the rest.*


*Focus on the things that are truly in your control and do whatever you can to ensure you are satisfied with your input. Deal with the output when it happens.*


*After all the twists and turns that took place in the last month, I was able to recover from an injury and discovered my love for Yoga , I was able to put together thoughts about what I would like my new venture to be like , spoke to people most dear to me daily , grew fonder of falling in love with the NOW.*


*All things considered; I could not have asked for a better outcome.* *It’s never easy changing the way you react to situations, but it is something I urge you all to practice as much as you can. The day we focus more on the input is the day we receive the desired output.*
