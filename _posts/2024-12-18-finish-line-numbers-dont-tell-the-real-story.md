**This blog is designed to resonate deeply with anyone who has ever set a goal and experienced the highs and lows of a long-term journey. By focusing on the deeper aspects of success, I hope to tap into some universal human experiences.**

On Jan 22, 2024, I wrote my last blog on my marathon training. I was 5 weeks away from running the New Delhi Marathon. The training plan was destroying me week after another. It was the first time in ten years of running, I was crushing 100km weeks. I was nervous, excited and curious to see how my body and mind were going to process this mileage. And the excitement also translated in me penning down every run of my training plan.  
I would come back home from my run, wash up, tend to the chaffing, eat and quickly sit down to pen down my run. But as the mileage started going up and recovery became more and more important, I do admit that it became an ambitious task to separately log the emotions and expressions of 5 runs a week. I stopped writing about my runs. Completely.


Here are the blogs I wrote -

## **The 100km Weeks: Navigating the mileage. Did I survive?**


The second consecutive 100km week got me tightly wrapped up in eating right, eating more, doing mobility, visiting the physiotherapist, squeezing a nap when I could - and amidst all this what seemed easy didn’t come with ease!


I am not a strong long-distance runner and understanding this makes it easy for me to work hard. The 42.2k mindset and physical training needed my extra effort at gradually making it effortless.

The100km weeks of the marathon training plan were creating different life scenes for me and family everyday! My family found me napping during car rides. I woke up early not for runs, but to finish parts of my work that needed me to be fresh both mentally and physically.  
I crashed while playing scrabble with my son at 9 pm, I fretted over stocking both my refrigerators because I was RUNGRY ( a term used for forever hungry runners) most of the time. Somedays all I wanted was to crawl into my bed with my phone on airplane mode and my kids to be taken over by a friend. The smallest niggle in my body converted into a panic and crib session to my runner and non-runner friends. I love these friends who voluntarily choose to befriend a ‘marathoner under training’! My kids had donated their weekends to their marathon-mom’s long runs and the pre-run rest and post-run recovery.


## **Race Day and the Finish Line! But Something’s Amiss!**


5 weeks later, I stood at the start line excited to run a 42.2! I was elated at earning my first Sub 4 marathon timings. On my way back home, I spent 45 minutes taking calls and speaking to my family. They wanted to know if I was happy with my  timings.


*Was I? Yes. But was that the only thing I was truly happy about? Not really.*  
*Why not?* *Because marathon timings don’t tell the real story.*  
*Where is the real story?* *It’s in the months and years of training leading to the race day.*

### The true story unfolded long before that final sprint*.*


When we think of marathons, the finish line is the most iconic part of the race. It’s where athletes are celebrated, the crowds cheer, and the stopwatch stops. But what if I told you that the numbers at the finish line don’t always reflect the full, inspiring journey of the runner/athlete?


### **The Immense Growth & The Messy Middle:**


The amateur runners follow a plan week after week, discipline themselves every day, cut out the unnecessary/ meaningless, run on fatigued legs and side by side play full personal and professional lives beyond the marathon training. The race day is a matter of a few hours while the training lasts many months if not years. It is a suffering of a kind.


Dostoevsky said – *“I better be worthy of my sufferings’’*.


Will I grow from this suffering? After am done training for this physical and mental challenge of running 42.2kms…. after the terrific highs and lows of training…. the messy middle of handling injuries,  keeping up with the daily….after all this…will I ever be the same? To me that is exactly what training for a marathon has come to. The ‘messy middle’ which is a large chunk of the training, that’s where the transformation happens.

The victory is a story for the world, for social media. The timings are a great personal validation. The medal is a hard-earned piece of metal! But next time you watch someone cross the finish line, look beyond - the applause, the instant glory.  The triumph was manifested in the 5 a.m. alarms, when the world was still asleep, and they were lacing up their shoes for another run that felt like it’s leading nowhere. It’s in the athlete who spends years perfecting a skill, only to face failure after failure, yet rises each time, despite the growing doubts. It’s in the single mom who works two jobs, missing birthdays and family dinners, to provide a future she might never see. It’s in the entrepreneur who faced rejection, failure, and uncertainty multiple times before she achieved her big breakthrough. It’s in the moments that no one claps for. The moments that shape you when no one’s watching.

Do you agree? What’s your real “finish line” story? Have you ever reached a goal only to realize that real growth happened long before the finish?
