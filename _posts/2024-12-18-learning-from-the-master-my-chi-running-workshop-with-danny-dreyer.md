Some days, running feels like pure freedom — effortless, as if I’m gliding on air. Other days, it’s a battle — my legs heavy, my breath shallow, and every step a reminder that how much more there is to discover - from technique and nutrition to the mental strategies that keep me going on tough days. But that’s the beauty of it. I’ve been on this journey for 10 years, and I’m still fascinated by how the body adapts, how the mind perseveres, and how every run holds the potential for growth. I want to run for the rest of my life, and I’m committed to learning everything I can to make that possible — and my limits are not about ‘farther’ and ‘faster’ but to do it with the kind of wisdom that allows me to keep running, year after year.


And ……when you get the chance to learn directly from the person who invented a transformative running practice, you take it. That’s exactly what I did when I attended a [Ch](https://chiliving.com/chirunning/)[iRunning](https://chiliving.com/chirunning/) workshop led by [D](https://www.amazon.in/stores/Danny-Dreyer/author/B001H6Q8NO?ref=ap_rdr&isDramIntegrated=true&shoppingPortalEnabled=true)[anny Dreyer](https://www.amazon.in/stores/Danny-Dreyer/author/B001H6Q8NO?ref=ap_rdr&isDramIntegrated=true&shoppingPortalEnabled=true) himself—the founder of this revolutionary approach to running.  
I went in expecting to pick up a few tips to make my runs easier and more efficient. What I left with was a brilliant shift in how I think about movement, effort, and flow.


## **Meeting Danny Dreyer: A Calm Force**


My impressions of Danny come from the 6.5 hours of intense learning from him. Danny Dreyer isn’t just a running coach. He’s a storyteller, philosopher, and a master of simplifying the complex. From the moment he began speaking, it was clear this wasn’t going to be a technical lecture about foot placement and stride length. Instead, it was an invitation to rethink how I moved—starting with my mind.

Danny’s calm, centered presence set the tone for the workshop. He explained how Chi Running draws from Tai Chi principles, emphasizing energy efficiency, alignment, and the power of mindfulness.  
  
“This isn’t about forcing your body to run,” he said. “It’s about letting your body run.”


## **A Masterclass in Effortless Movement**


Danny guided us through the fundamentals: posture, core engagement, and the famous Chi Running forward ‘fall’. We were encouraged to notice how we carried ourselves, both standing still and in motion. As we practiced under his watchful eye, I noticed how subtle shifts—like straightening my spine or relaxing my shoulders, activated my core and made me feel that I was running downhill even when I was not! He advised me on my arm swing, something I had been struggling with on my speed workouts. I practiced it at the workshop and 2 runs later – I can already feel the difference. Am happy that I know better today, and mindful that without practice, knowing isn’t going to fix anything.


## **Gravity is your Ally**


It’s intriguing how Chi Running encourages us to stop muscling through runs and instead focus on flow. “Gravity is your ally,” Danny reminded us, demonstrating how to ‘fall’ into a run without overexertion and without literally ‘falling’. What struck me was the emphasis on efficiency over force. Instead of powering through runs, Chi Running invites you to work with natural forces like gravity and momentum. Leaning slightly forward from the ankles, for instance, allows gravity to pull you forward, reducing the strain on your legs.  
  
The transformation was immediate. By the end of the workshop, I felt lighter on my feet, more efficient in my movement, and a more confident about handling my ankle injuries!


## **Lessons on Long-Term Running**


I have 2 of these.


My first takeaway from the workshop was Chi Running’s perspective on effort. Running—isn’t about pushing harder. It’s about aligning with the forces already at play and using them to your advantage. Because that’s exactly how movement—and effort—can be both effective and sustainable. Don’t push harder; move smarter. Going forwards with gravity during a run felt like a metaphor for leaning into life’s natural flow and letting go of resistance.


The other lesson came when Danny asked us to observe the kids running in the park.  When kids run, they don’t worry about their pace or the distance ahead. They simply move with abandon, propelled by excitement, with bodies light, their spirits free.


“Run like a kid” — it’s an invitation to reconnect with the innate playfulness and freedom, unburdened by the constraints we often place on ourselves. It’s not about mimicking childish form — it’s about ‘not overthinking’ and running with your whole being. ( If running hasn’t turned you into a philosopher yet, are you sure you’ve been running enough??)


## **Still Want to Know Why This Workshop Was Worth It?**


If running feels more like a chore or you’re dealing with recurring injuries, or you love to learn about various techniques of running, Chi Running might be worth exploring. The adjustments are subtle but can have a big impact on how you feel during and after a run. Of course, learning from the creator (Danny Dreyer) of such a widely practiced running technique gives me more than enough reason to learn!  
  
I didn’t leave the workshop a faster runner, but I left a more mindful one. And maybe, that’s even better.


Delighted to share that the runner-bloggers at Wellthyfit had explored ChiRunning a while back. There are some wonderful articles on ChiRunning on it that explain the technique in detail.
