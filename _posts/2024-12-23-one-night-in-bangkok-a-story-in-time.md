Few days before 2023 ended, I had an unforgettable encounter on the 'walking streets' of Bangkok. After a long day at the zoo, and the amusement park with my family, I came back to the hotel with an evening plan for myself. I quickly headed to the local market for a 60-minute massage to cool down my aching feet from walking 40,000 steps that day. I was in my second phase of marathon training plan and I had run a 12km that morning. In the day, my kids excitedly made me take quick steps to skip long queues at the amusement park.


My legs were begging for rest but I wanted to be out because nights in Bangkok are something else. The hustle and bustle on the streets of Bangkok is very attractive to a big city girl.


For my achy feet I planned to get the famous Thai foot massage and for the hungry runner girl in me …I was going to have a Chinese fish platter! All of this …all by myself.

The walk to the night market was barely 400 meters from my hotel….and I felt like I had 10kg ankle weights tied on. I was hopeful on finding a good foot massage parlour in a matter of minutes…and then my eyes fell upon a young girl standing on the entrance of the street. She was tall, white skinned and had poker straight hair. Her glass skin gave me an instant inferiority complex. She wore a mint-colored jumpsuit. Her feet were inside a pair of ill-fitting heels. She looked famished and lean.  Her pearl ear-rings matched her skin tone. She carried a fake Louis Vuitton bag in one hand and her phone in another. She was a stunner! I couldn’t take my eyes off her.


She looked focused, in a visible hurry....her gaze fixed on the side of the road where people walked into the street. I quickly understood that the street was her office. It was clear that she was looking for potential clients. A few steps after I crossed her, I stopped and thought…. what if I had dinner with this girl?

But, would she agree?


And, should I ask?


Would I scare her with this thought? Is this a weird idea?


Why am I even thinking like this? ( It's almost a year and this question stays)


I was standing 20 meters ahead of her with so many questions on my mind and yet I started walking towards her.


I knew why I wanted to talk to her. The language barrier could ruin it all. The confusion in my head was at many levels.


I took a deep breath and asked her - *What's your name?* She didn't reply and dismissed me. I asked her a different question - *Will you have dinner with me?*


She looked through me. I was ready for that and about to turn around. And then quickly came an answer - "*I am ‘into’ men only".* Ah, I hadn't imagined this interpretation of my question. So I smiled, cheek to cheek, and told her – I liked men too, and had no sexual interest in her.


She, again, stared at me for a bit and asked me if I was a journalist? I assured her I was nothing more than a curious woman at this point in time. But something worked and I don’t know what it was because she assured me that if 50 minutes later she hadn’t found a suitable client, she would message me.


My phone beeped 40 minutes later. It was the newly saved and self-given name -  JASMINE!!! ( That's the name I decided to give her, because she never told me her name)


I had never done this before and I was scared. I was scared because I wanted to ask her so many questions and not ever hurt her with my curiosity. I also wondered what part of me had suddenly gotten so excited about this whole idea. Didn’t I come to the market with a plan?


We sat in a small Thai restaurant. I asked her to order whatever she liked. To this, she informed me that she kept her belly light before she had sex with a client and ate well only after her job was done.


Hearing this, my head exploded for a few seconds. But my biases, my conditioning on prostitution as a 'job' made it hard for me to accept that every job comes with its own set of prerequisites.


She approved of Sushi as a light meal and I added a chicken ramen for myself.


As we began our rendezvous, Jasmine looked more curious than I. Unsure of my intentions, she made it clear that no pictures of hers would be taken while we spoke and the phone voice recorder would be kept off. I assured her and then she gave me the sweetest smile and asked me what was I seeking from her.


I knew what I wanted from her - peer inside her life as a sex-worker. I communicated this to her in exact words.


Her expressions changed quickly and a big frown on her face surfaced. She communicated to me on Google translator that she won’t answer if she didn’t like my questions.


Google translator was the supporting actor that night for me. Language was definitely a barrier between us. She knew a little more than basic English and I was an illiterate at Thai language. And I was sure that this was going to be a complex discussion!


So I decided to focus on Jasmine’s facial expressions and the emotions behind her words.


After some major communication struggle, we agreed to type our questions and answers to each other apart from having a simple worded conversation around it. But between typing the question and showing her the question there was always a suspense if she would answer it for me. I was a stranger to her after all.


I asked Jasmine about how she got into prostitution. I assumed she didn’t pick this out of choice. This assumption is hugely debatable, I understand.


Jasmine took a moment before she answered my question. I figured she hadn’t been asked this often. She took time and drafted her answer in her head before she spoke. It was so evident.  She then told me that 4 years back, it was her father’s life-taking medical emergency that pushed Jasmine to become a sex-worker. It was the quickest way for her to generate money for his surgeries.  Her brothers were still young, and her mother’s income was meagre. Before she decided to take the sex-worker route, she had asked her then boyfriend for money, worked various small jobs but the amount never added to even one-fourth of what was needed. Even though her father is better now, today this income funds her and her brother’s education, along with other household expenses. Typical life of many poor young Thai girls and their families, I wondered?


I asked her if this is what she wanted to do for the rest of her life.


Pat came an answer from Jasmine. NO. She kept nodding her head and kept saying no, no, no. Her eyes beamed when she said that she was studying to become a banker and aspired to move to Singapore and work there. She didn’t use the google translator to tell me that she wished to get married and have children.


She didn’t like her life as a sex-worker.


I was very curious at this point in time. What was the worst part about being a sex-worker, I wondered, but then could there be anything nice about being one? I knew Jasmine won’t answer this question and l left the question behind.


My questions in my head were endless. Time was less and she still had to find a client. I had to limit my questions.


I asked Jasmine if she had ever been in love. She was only 22. Did her clients fall in love with her?


She went quiet for a bit and she very slowly reached out to her plate of Sushi. I told her it was fine if she didn’t want to answer that one. But she typed and described her clients as indifferent and exploitative men who label women like Jasmine as public property.


She then typed an involute question on Google Translator for me:


“You won’t give away your body to a different man every day and often, if it weren’t for the money you badly needed. Would you?”.


She stopped at that. There was so much uneasiness on Jasmine’s face, her expressions told me that she was waiting for me to change the topic and she made it evident by drinking lots of sips of water.


Jasmine was such a warm and candid girl. In her own ways, she shared about her life as a daily sex-worker. She kept opening up a little by little. She seemed like a natural born survivor when she shared her episodes of what shame felt like to her just when she had started out as a prostitute.


While we talked, she often took out her phone and checked her make up in the selfie camera.  Then she took out white face powder and touched upon her cheeks a few times. I reminded myself that it was part of her job to look pretty every moment.


Jasmine was done with her Sushi and she was ready to leave. We had spent 90 minutes together. But before jasmine left, I made a parting deal with her. I promised her a banking job in Singapore, only if she finished her education. We exchanged email ids.

We gave each other a tight hug. I hung on hugging a bit longer than my usual. She had given me her time, her thoughts. I wished her a happy and healthy life. I wished that our lives intersected again in a different place and better circumstances for her.


I walked back to my hotel. I had just spent an evening with a determined girl, harbouring a dream for education and a family. At 19, she took charge of doing hard things for her father. It takes everything to grow up overnight. At 22, she is educating herself and her brothers. She believes in the power of education. And she believes it is this power that can change her life. But I wondered how long would she have to work as a sex-worker to truly get free from it.


Twelve months later, I still think of that evening with Jasmine. She’s changed her mobile number and I don’t know where she is at the moment. There are no replies from her to my emails.


Back in my own bubble, I see that the world is full of perspectives on prostitution as a real job and compare it to any other job that pays our bills. But I find it hard to accept this stance. I cannot imagine a woman being one with sweat, saliva and semen of different men every other day and leaving it at – “Oh! It’s just like any other job”.


It scares me to imagine how those men in their most intimate physical state of being would treat a sex-worker.  In any other job, even the most menial ones, women might still be treated with some respect. But will a sex-worker, be given any respect – both in and out of it. Will she get a raise for having years of experience as a sex-worker? Does the ‘experience’ even count towards anything like it does for all other jobs? Will the various award platforms that facilitate women from various walks of life ever call upon a sex-worker?


I don’t think so.


It’s true that every woman deserves respect regardless of how she has chosen to meet her needs. But I highlight that disliking one’s job as a sex-worker is not in comparison with disliking our sales/ marketing …’regular’ jobs.


It's been12 months later. It was the night of 27th December 2023 when I saw and met Jasmine. I still am in awe of her strength of character. She is an intelligent woman who understands that her life as a sex-worker is not sustainable over a long period of time and it comes with a huge price on her mental, physical and emotional health.


That one night in Bangkok stays with me as an extremely beautiful memory. Am so thankful to Jasmine for having spent all that time with me and trusting a stranger with her thoughts. How I wish that she stumbled upon this blog!


That night when I came back to the hotel, I watched my daughter sleep blissfully. It was my daughter’s birthday the very next day. I set my pillow to make it my backrest to say my prayers ….and in my prayers were two young beautiful women.
