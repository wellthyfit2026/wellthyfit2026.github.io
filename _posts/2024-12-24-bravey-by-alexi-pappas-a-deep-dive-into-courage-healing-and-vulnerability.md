I read “Bravey” by Alexis Papas in the summer of 2024. I was jetlagged from a 15-hour flight from Delhi to San Fracisco. In the wee hours of my second night of jet lag, I walked up to a little library at home. My eyes fell at the title of the book which I thought was carrying a spelling mistake!


## **Who is Alexi Pappas?**


Alexi Pappas is 34, an Olympian and an award-winning filmmaker. She competed in the 2016 Rio Olympics for Team Greece and set a national record in the 10k with a time of 31:36. She's published multiple books and directed several feature-length films. She lives in the Unites States of America.


I came across one of her most beautiful interviews where in she talks about being introduced to running at the age of 8 by her father and it was her first introduction to the idea of 'good pain' as she says in her own words.

## **Before I say** **more....**


In this blog, I will say a lot about her book but before that -  I must share that I loved this book because it made me rethink everything I know about living in the ‘comfort zone’. Reading through some of her strategies on conquering fears and insecurities, I wish this book was available to me when I was in my teens. She lays down the most vulnerable stories from her growing up years  to turning into a young woman and an athlete. I imagined her words turning into scenes in front of my eyes.  I felt deeply both as a parent today and a teenager once!


Now in my 40s, I take a lot from this book also as an amateur athlete and the emotional intelligence I need to develop is one big learning going forward. In the midst of running a hard run workout, I will now tell myself - "*pain is a sensation, not a threat*".


## ***Bravey: Chasing Dreams, Befriending Pain, and Other Big Ideas*** – **My Take**


In this book, Pappas blends personal stories as a child, a teenager and young woman growing up to be an athlete with insights on resilience, bravery, and the pursuit of one’s dreams. Beyond her success story as an elite Greek-American athlete, through the most vulnerable parts her book, I felt that Alexi Papas was obsessed not so much with winning, or being an Olympian, but with redefining the word ‘Bravery” - the kind of Bravery that is extremely relevant to the world we live in today! That bravery isn’t about conquering the world; it’s about conquering your own fears, doubts, and insecurities.


It’s the kind of bravery that doesn’t make headlines—but should.


In this blog, I’ll take you through the heart and soul of Pappas’ book through her powerful quotes and the stories that bring them to life.

**I was running, but I wasn’t living. I was winning, but I wasn’t breathing. I was succeeding, but I wasn’t free**


This line in Bravey echoed in my head long after I read it.


She opens up about the classic “success without fulfillment” dilemma, and it’s a feeling that will resonate deeply with anyone who has ever hit a professional milestone only to find that achieving it didn’t bring the happiness they expected. You’re standing at the top of the mountain, but somehow, it feels like you’ve lost something along the way – the dark side of competition.


And maybe that’s the gift of this book—at least, for me. Alexi shares the kind of raw, unfiltered truth that we’re all too afraid to say out loud. She holds a mirror up to our deepest insecurities, our hidden fears, and our unspoken doubts—and then, in the most beautiful way, she teaches us to embrace them.


### **Sometimes we have to let go of the life we planned, to embrace the one that’s waiting for us.”**


For years, she worked tirelessly toward becoming an Olympic athlete, a goal that seemed clear and attainable. But the reality of her journey, like most elite athletes—filled with injuries, failures, and setbacks—showed her that sometimes, the best thing you can do is let go of the life you imagined and be open to what’s unfolding in front of you. It’s tough, and easier said that done.


After her Olympic dreams were upended by an injury, Pappas found herself at a crossroads. She had to let go of the athlete identity she had clung to for so long. Yet, this surrender didn’t lead to defeat. Instead, it opened new doors for her. She turned her attention to storytelling, creating the film Tracktown, which became a platform for her to explore her identity beyond just running. Her willingness to embrace the unknown brought forth unexpected opportunities. There was no time for ‘comfort zone’ !


My take as an amateur athlete: This lesson in adaptability speaks to anyone facing uncertainty or a major life transition. There is beauty in releasing control, and sometimes the best things happen when you stop trying to force them.


## **A Love Letter to the Process**


Alexi emphasizes the beauty of the process over the end result. In a world obsessed with outcomes—winning medals, achieving status, and hitting benchmarks – she writes to inspire her readers to shift their focus onto the daily practices, the rituals, the messy, imperfect steps that ultimately lead us to success. This mindset shift is especially revolutionary in a culture obsessed with hustle culture and overnight success stories all over social-media.


This is also the part where I felt she was speaking to me and for me - For Alexi  running wasn’t only about crossing the finish line. It was about the hours of training, the constant self-questioning, the highs and lows, and the deep personal discoveries made along the way. This is an essential truth for anyone embarking on a meaningful endeavor, and not just an athletic pursuit.

### **Storytelling and Representation**


As an athlete, artist, and filmmaker, Pappas is also aware of the importance of representation. Bravey is an example of how telling one’s story can create connections, spark conversations, and foster a sense of belonging. In a world that often champions narratives of perfection, Pappas’ willingness to share her true, unfiltered self, made me connect with her narrative, not just as an amateur athlete but even as a parent of a growing up children who are a new generation of dreamers, athletes pursuing their passions unapologetically.


### **Why Bravey Will Stick With You**


Whether you’re a runner, a writer, an artist, or just someone trying to navigate life’s challenges, Bravey speaks to the part of you that is capable of more than you think. Pappas encourages us to ask ourselves the tough questions: What would it look like to be brave in your own life? How would you show up differently if you stopped letting fear dictate your actions?


If you’ve ever doubted yourself, if you’ve ever been afraid to chase your dreams, or if you’re simply looking for a book that will push you to be more courageous in your own life, Bravey is a great read.


So, what are you waiting for? The world needs your story.
