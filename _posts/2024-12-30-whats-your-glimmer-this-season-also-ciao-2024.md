As 2024 winds down, I am naturally drawn to looking back at the big moments—the highs, the lows, the “I can’t believe I survived that” moments. Few years back, I had even[written down](https://wellthyfit.com/2019-12-31-highs-and-lows-of-2019/)[a blog on the highs and lows of 2019.](https://wellthyfit.com/2019-12-31-highs-and-lows-of-2019/) But today I look at my time, my journey on this planet.....differently. A lot more makes up my personality and not just went what right or wrong in that year! Sure the hard-earned achievements and the goals bring me an encouraging happiness, but they don't quite capture the sense of wholeness I feel today. It's about wholeness over happiness today!


Enter glimmers. Life's little happy accidents - or mini joy bombs that turn the most ordinary days into something special! It’s the little moments—the unexpected sparks in my day—those fleeting glimpses of joy, the quiet gratitude on tough days, the simple things that turned my frowns into smiles—it is in those moments...I find myself silently saying, “Thank you, God.”


In this blog, I'll share some of my glimmer moments from the last couple of months!


## Ready to find the magic in the little things? Wondering what these mini bombs of joy look like?


A few days before Diwali, I had gone a little overboard with the lights in my house—strings of them draped everywhere, filling the space with a brilliant glow. The next morning, as usual, I found myself in the balcony, cradling a warm cup of tea. The sky was still bathed in the deep, tranquil hues of dawn, and the air was cool against my skin, a light shawl wrapped around me. In that moment, I felt as if I were surrounded by a soft, celestial aurora—my own little world of gentle radiance. A quiet sense of peace washed over me, and I smiled, savoring the stillness. It was my perfect moment of ‘glimmer’—a subtle, fleeting joy that made everything feel just right.

I stepped into the stadium at 5 a.m. on a chilly December morning, tired from hours on the road. The air was sharp, and fog swirled like a mystery around me. The floodlights flickered on, slicing through the haze and casting long shadows on the track. It was beautiful. A few runners dotted the field, each lost in their warm-up, preparing for their own run. The energy was palpable. Standing at the edge of the track, the empty lanes stretched out in front of me, and it felt like the whole stadium was mine to conquer. Time to push myself on another speed workout. My legs were ready. My mind locked in. No distractions—just pure focus.


Strava's feature called 'Your Sport In A Year' notifies me that I have run 1080 laps here in 2024. Tomorrow is my last run workout of the year at this very track! This track has been my constant, my glimmer this whole year.

I had just finished a hard run running along the edge of the Sukhna Lake, my breath still heavy, my body buzzing with the effort. I sat down facing and taking in the sight of the Kasauli i lights glimmering softly. The lake, now alive with runners, walkers, and chatter, pulsed with energy. I got up to leave to get to my car, but something made me turn back. In that moment, I saw the sun breaking free from the horizon, flooding the lake with red and golden light. Each wave caught its brilliance. For the last 28 years, I’ve watched the sun rise over this lake many times over, yet each sunrise carries its own magic, its own quiet miracle.

It’s the season of tender embraces, and in this soft, quiet time, I find my glimmer in warm hugs. There’s something deeply moving about watching my teenage daughter wrap her arms around her grandmother, a gesture so pure and instinctive that it seems to release the weight of generations, of all the women in my family that I never got to see, never got to talk to or know. The warmth of their closeness, the silent exchange of love —it all feels like a moment suspended in time... as if the very essence of family, of connection, is held in the gentleness of their hug.

I'll remind you one thing about 'glimmers'. They aren’t loud, but they’re real. They’re not life-altering events, but they have a way of making everything feel a little brighter.


I'd love to know what's been glimmering for you.


Here's to finding more glimmers, big and small, in the new year! Have a cozy last day of the year ! See you in 2025!
